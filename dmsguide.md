## Game Master's Guide



### What You Need To Play

As a Game Master you need at least these 3 things before you can run your game:

- A Town
- A Dungeon
- Some Wilderness

And that's it. Actually you don't even need that much, just the _name_ of a town will work, enough rooms of the dungeon finished to last a few hours, and one, maybe two encounters your players might see on the way to the dungeon.


### Running the Game

- level 1 players are pretty much adventurers who have just picked up a weapon
- how I intend the rules to be run vs how you run the rules
- magical world, not low magic, not high magic, somewhere inbetween
- dangerous world, small bit on the world the rules were created for

- what you need to play (town, dungeon, players)

### The world of Farhome

- what are warrens and realms?
- quick start level 1 adventures.

### Adventuring Day

- what resources players have and how to spend them
- resting vs other games?

### Building Combat Encounters

- CR vs Monster Level
- how difficult should encounters be, example encounter for 1st level parties
- action economy not as impactful as other games
- wound management?
- a prepared party vs an unprepared party
- surprise rounds

Once per day you may cast Wall of Faith, automatically succeeding the roll. When holding this emblem you may reroll 1 die when making Religion checks.

#### Sky Stone

A large blue orb with storm clouds swirling inside. While attuned to this item all Lightning spells you cast start with 1 crit (but no successes) and you may reroll 1 die for those rolls.
