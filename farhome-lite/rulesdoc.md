## Your Character
Each character is represented by 4 main attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, and Charisma. Your attributes govern nearly every aspect of your character and are used to determine things from how good you are at swinging a sword to how convincing an arguement you can make. Each attribute covers a range of actions and give different bonuses.

### Strength
Strength influences the physical side of your character; how well they can swing a sword, how much they can lift, to how resistant they are to disease and poison. Strength is the primary attribute for melee weapons. Each point of Strength increases your max wounds by 1.

### Dexterity
Dexterity is a measure of your characters balance, agility, and accuracy. Dexterity governs your ability to sneak quietly, perform a feat of acrobatics, and how well you can use a bow or throw a dagger. Dexterity is the primary attribute for ranged weapons and melee weapons with the _finesse_ property.

### Intelligence
Intelligence is your raw strength of mind and determines everything from your ability to cast spells, to how easily you recall knowledge, or to how well you can investigate and find the smallest of details. Intelligence is the primary attribute for arcane spells. Each point of Intelligence increases how many spells you can prepare by 2.

### Charisma
Charisma governs the social aspects of your character, from your ability to convince others, perform or play an instrument, and cast divine spells. Charisma is the primary attribute for divine spells.

Each proficiency has its own proficiency score associated with it. Each level you may increase a proficiency by 1, up to a maximum of 5. When rolling one of your skills you add successes equal to your proficiency score.

## Spells
There are two main schools of magic: Arcane and Divine. Arcane spells draw power from the elements, being able to summon lightning bolts or launch fireballs. Arcane spells also deal with the raw force of magic, allowing you to create illusions or conjure objects. Divine spells allow you to heal and enchant others to protect them from harm, smite evil creatures, or raise the dead to fight for you.
