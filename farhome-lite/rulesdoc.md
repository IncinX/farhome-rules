## Your Character

### Attributes
Your character is governed by 4 core numbers called attributes. These define how strong, smart, or resilient your character is and are used in almost every roll. By default the highest your Attribute scores can go is 5, but items or other effects can increase this.

##### Body
Body is a measure of how physically capable you are. Body covers everything from how fast you can run, how much you can carry, and how strong you are.

##### Mind
Mind represents your mental ability and your ability to cast spells. Mind covers everything from how perceptive you are, how much you know about nature, the world and magic, to how skilled you are at casting spells.

##### Stamina
Stamina is a measure of your body's constitution. Stamina covers how your body resists poisons and disease, how many hits you can take in combat, or how easy you are to get tired. Each point of Stamina increases your max wounds by 1.

##### Charisma
Charisma represents your force of personality. Charisma covers how well you can persuade others, how good you are at performing or playing an instrument, even how skilled you are at casting divine spells.

### Wounds
Your characters health is tracked in wounds, representing how much damage you can take before going unconscious. When taking damage that leaves you at 0 wounds or below your character falls unconscious. Wounds can be healed through spells, resting, and rolling healing surges. In some cases you may gain temporary wounds, with any damage reducing your temporary wounds first.

#### Healing Surges
The maximum healing surges you can have at one time is your Stamina score + 1. During a short or long rest you can spend a healing surge to roll 3 wound dice, healing for the number of wounds rolled. After each long rest you replenish 3 of your healing surges.

#### Dying and Death Saves
In most cases when your reduced to 0 wounds or below your character falls unconscious. If you take enough damage that half your max wounds woun't bring you above 0 you outright die instead of falling unconscious. When unconscious you gain temporary wounds equal to half your maximum, rounded up. Each turn you make a Death save by rolling a single wound die, on a wound you lose a temporary wound otherwise nothing happens. When you lose your last temporary wound your character dies.

When unconscious you can still be attacked or hit by magical effects. If any of these deal damage it is applied to your temporary wounds. A player can resuscitate you by healing you with a spell or item restoring any missing temporary wounds first. As long as the healing is enough to restore your temporary wounds you wake up, with any remaining healing restoring wounds. A player can also make a Mind skill check to stablize you. If they are beside you they can spend 7 AP to make the check, adding 1 Terrible die for every missing temporary wound. On success the dying player is stablized and no longer makes death saves, waking up after 10 minutes.

#### Temporary Wounds
Temporary wounds act as a buffer, with any damage reducing temporary wounds before your normal wounds. Temporary wounds, once lost cannot be regained through healing. The maximum temporary wounds you can have is half your max wounds, rounded up, gaining temporary wounds past that point has no effect.

### Move and Sprint Speed
Each character has a movespeed based on their race. Your move speed is the number of tiles you can move when taking the Move action on your turn. Your sprint speed is 1 + your Body score, and is the number of tiles you can move when taking the Sprint action.

### Skills and Saving Throws
Eventually you will need to roll some dice, and some of the most common rolls are Skill Checks and Saving Throws. Each attribute has a related Skill Check and Saving Throw. Skill Checks are used when you are trying to do something related to that attribute. For example, trying to climb a wall, break down a door, or lift a heavy boulder would all fall under a Body skill check. Saving throws are made when something happens to your character. For example, diving out of the way to avoid a trap would be a Body saving throw, or resisting the poison from a poison dart would be a Stamina saving throw.

### Weapons and Spells
In addition to skill checks and saving throws, you also have attack and spellcasting rolls. Attack rolls are split into two different categories, melee attacks and ranged attacks. Melee attacks are everything from swinging a sword to using your fists to hitting something with a big two handed hammer. Ranged attacks cover all ranged weapons, such as bows, crossbows, to even throwing a javelin or dagger. All attacks are based on your Body attribute.

Spellcasting is divided into two schools: Arcane spells and Divine spells. Arcane spells cover everything from shooting fire from your fingertips, turning people into frogs, creating illusions, or even teleporting to a new place. All Arcane spells use Mind as its attribute. Divine spells cover spells that heal, protect from or remove bad effects, to destroying undead or monstrous creatures. Divine spells use Charisma as its attribute.

#### Spell Slots
To be able to cast a spell, just knowing the spell isn't enough. You need a spell slot of equal or higher level to cast a spell. Depending on your backgrounds your character will have a number of spell slots that increase as you level up. Casting a spell uses up a spell slot, but you regain spell slots every time you rest, up to your characters maximum.

You don't need to match a spells level to cast a spell, you can use a spell slot with a higher level than the spell to increase the spells power. For example, you can cast a 1st level spell by using a 1st level spell slot or you can use a 2nd level spell slot to increase its potency. What benefits you get for casting at a higher level are listed in the spells discription. 

Even Cantrips can be cast at a higher level, and are considered 0 level spells. This means using a 1st level spell slot will give a bonus to cantrips.

#### Preparing Spells
Another requirement for casting spells is having the spell prepared. Magic is difficult and requires constant study to keep the spells ready. Every time you long rest you can prepare a new set of spells. The number of spells you can prepare at any one time is equal to 5 plus 3 for every point of Mind you have.

As long as you have spell slots remaining you may cast any prepared spell as many times as you want. For example, if I prepare the _Firebolt_ cantrip, I can cast it one time, every time, or never end up casting it.

Prepared spells will eventually fade from your mind. Every time you make an Exhaustion roll due to skipping sleep or staying awake too long you have a chance of forgetting your prepared spells. Failing the Exhaustion roll causes you to forget everything but your cantrips, requiring you to take a long rest if you want to prepare more spells.

#### Codex
Before you can prepare a spell you need to have it written down somewhere. This is done in a spellbook, or codex. The codex holds all the spells you know, and you need to have your codex to be able to prepare spells from it. There's no limit to the number of spells you can have in your codex. When you find spell scrolls or other codices you can copy the spell into your spellbook. Copying is a destructive act, and will destroy the spell scroll or codex after copying 1 spell from it.

#### Cantrips
Cantrips are special spells that don't require a spell slot to cast, as long as they are prepared they are always available. Cantrips can still be cast at a higher level, and are considered 0 level spells for determining bonuses. When casting at a higher level you need a spell slot of that level to cast, regardless of if the spell is a Cantrip or not.

### Defense
When defending against attacks and some spells you will need to make a Defense roll. Defense is gained through the armor you wear, if you have a shield, and can be effected by talents or abilities. Defense rolls use their own dice:

- **Silver (Superior)**
- **Bronze (Normal)**

Depending on your armor, you will be rolling a mix of superior or normal defense dice. When not wearing armor you roll a single normal defense die.

### Proficiency
While attributes represent your raw potential in a given area, proficiency represents your training and how skilled you are in those tasks. When your character gains a level they gain a proficiency point they can spend on making skills, saving throws, attacks or spellcasting better. You don't gain any benefit from proficiency scores higher than your attribute score for a given roll. For example, if your Body attribute is 2, having 3 or more proficiency in Body skill checks give no additional benefit.

### Determining Rolls
There are a few things that determine which dice, and how many you roll. For rolls based on an Attribute (such as skills, saving throws, attacks, spells, etc) you will choose from 5 different dice, listed from best to worst:

- **Yellow (Superior)**
- **Green (Skill)**
- **White (Normal)**
- **Red (Bad)**
- **Purple (Terrible)**

For attribute rolls, you start with 5 White dice. For every point of the relevant Attribute, such as Body for Body skill checks, you replace one White die with a Green die. After that, for every point of proficiency you replace a Green die with a Yellow die. If you don't have any Green dice to replace any remaining proficiency points have no effect.

>Lets look at an example Body skill check with 3 Body and 2 proficiency.

>|  |  |  |  |  |  |
>|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
>| Base | W | W | W | W | W |
>| Attributes | G | G | G | W | W |
>| Proficiency | Y | Y | G | W | W |
>| End | Y | Y | G | W | W |

In some cases you might have more than 5 for your attribute score. This is possible through talents or items, and when making rolls with a score above 5 you add White dice for every attribute score above 5 you have. Proficiency replaces extra dice added to Green dice instead of Yellow.

### Creating a Character
You start by choosing a race. Your race determines a handful of your starting stats, such as your move speed, your starting wounds, a talent, and modifiers to your attribute scores. Once you have a race, it's best to determine your attributes next. Your attributes start at 0, adding any bonuses or negatives from your race. After that you get 4 points to add across all your attributes. The only limitation is that you cannot have an attribute greater than 3.

Next, pick a background. Backgrounds are special talents that give you a variety of stats and starting gear and determines what talents are available to your character. Finally you get 4 proficiency points to put into any of your skills. When adding proficiency to an attribute it increases both the skill check and saving throw proficiencies for that attribute.

### Leveling up
Eventually your characters will have progressed far enough to grow in strength, which is represented by your level. The max level is 10, with each level giving you a number of bonuses. Each time you level up you gain the following:

- Your max wounds increases by 1
- You gain 1 proficiency point
- You choose a new talent

In addition, some backgrounds effect what you gain when leveling up, such as getting new spell slots or abilities.

#### Attribute Score Increase
Starting at level 2 and every 2 levels after, when leveling up you increase one of your attribute scores by 1, up to a maximum of 5.

#### Action Point Increase
At levels 4, 7, and 10 your action point max increases by 1.


### Combat
When encountering hostile creatures you may end up in combat. In combat, each player or creature participating takes _turns_ in order. On your turn you have Action Points (or AP) to spend on a variety of actions. Once every player and creature has had a turn it marks the end of a _round_. Each round lasts 20 seconds in in-game time.

#### Initiative
When combat starts, every participating player and creature rolls initiative. Initiative determines the turn order, with higher initiative creatures going before lower initiative creatures.

To determine your initiative you make a roll based on your Body attribute. This roll isn't considered a skill check or saving throw, and is only effected by some backgrounds and talents. To make your roll you roll 5 White dice, replacing a White die with a Green die for every point of Body you have.

In some situations you or other creatures may be surprised. Surprised creatures add 3 failures to their Initiative rolls, and until they get their first turn any attacks against them have combat advantage.

#### On your Turn
Action Points, or AP, doesn't carry over from round to round. At the start of your turn your AP is set to your AP maximum, and you may take the following actions.

##### Move (3AP, Once per Turn)
When taking the move action, you may move up to your move speed in tiles. This movement doesn't have to happen all at once, and you may take other actions in between movements.

##### Sprint(2AP, Once per Turn, usable only after the Move action)
You may move up to your sprint speed in tiles. This movement follows the same rules as the Move action and may be split up between other actions.

##### Attack (5 AP)
You make an unarmed or weapon attack against a target in range.

##### Off-hand Attack (2 AP, can only be used after attack, once per turn)
If you are dual-wielding two weapons you can make an attack with your off-hand weapon. This acts the same as the Attack action, but uses your off-hand weapon instead.

##### Defend (5 AP, Once per Turn)
You take a defensive stance, adding 1 Defense die to your defense rolls, or 1 Superior Defense die if your wearing a shield. This lasts until the end of your next turn.

##### Casting (AP Varies)
You cast a spell you have prepared, as long as you meet the requirements for the spell. Each spell has their own AP cost, and as long as you have the AP there's no limit to the number of spells you can cast each turn.

##### Maneuver (AP Varies)
Maneuvers are special actions you can learn when leveling up. Each maneuver has it's own AP cost, and some have specific requirements in order to use. Maneuvers have a few other limitations:
 - You may only use a single maneuver each turn.
 - You can't use the same maneuver you used the previous turn.

##### Use (2 AP)
The default for using an item, drinking a potion, activating a magic item, or interacting with an object (eg: pulling a switch). Some magic items will give their own AP costs, using those instead. You can only drink one potion each round.

#### Reactions
Any AP you haven't spent on your turn can be spent on reactions. Reactions are special actions that are triggered by another creature taking some action. For example the spell _Counter Spell_ is a reaction that can only be used in response to another creature casting a spell. Creatures can take as many reactions as they want as long as they have enough AP to use those reactions.

Surprised creatures have 0 AP and so cannot take reactions until after their first turn in combat. Creatures that haven't had their first turn but aren't surprised have all of their AP available.

#### Zone of Control
Each creature in combat creates a zone of control around them. Some abilities effect all creatures inside your zone of control, and opponents leaving your zone of control are open to opportunity attacks.

Your zone of control covers all adjacent tiles when holding a melee weapon, extending out 1 tile if you have a weapon with _Reach_. Ranged weapons, such as bows or crossbows do not create zones of control.

#### Darkness
Depending on the action you gain bonuses or take penalties when taking actions in darkness. Most creatures cannot see in the dark, taking actions against a creature in darkness adds Red or Purple dice to your rolls. You add 1 Red die when attacking a creature in dim light, or 2 Purple dice when attacking a creature in darkness. A creature that can see in the dark has no penalties, and if the target cannot see them the attacker has combat advantage for the attack.

#### Cover
Creatures hiding behind cover add extra Superior Defense dice to their defense rolls or Yellow dice to their saving throws against ranged attacks and spells. There are two types of cover: partial and full cover. Partial cover would be given from something that either partially obscures you or is too small to fully hide behind, for example hiding behind a bush, or a wood fence. Full cover is given from something either large enough to hide behind or sturdy enough to block most attacks, such as a turned over table or hiding behind a stone wall. In either case cover gives you a bonus, with partial cover giving you 1 extra Superior Defense or Yellow die and full cover giving you 2 extra Superior Defense or Yellow dice.

### Resting
All adventurers need to rest from time to time. Resting replenishes your spell slots, your health, and can remove your exhaustion. There are two types of rests you can take: short rests and long rests. Short rests take an hour to complete while long rests take 8 hours, and you only get the benefit of the rest once the rest is completed. You can only take 2 short rests and 1 long rest a day, any more than that have no effect.

#### Short Rest
Short rests take an hour to complete. While resting you may roll any number of Healing Surges to restore missing wounds. If you have missing spell slots you restore up to 3 of them, starting with the lowest level slots and working your way up. Any talents or abilities that can only be used once per rest are recovered as well.

#### Long Rest
Long rests take 8 hours to complete. During your long rest you can spend at most 2 hours doing a simple, non-exhaustive task, such as preparing a meal or keeping watch. During your long rest you automatically heal 1 wound, and you may roll any number of Healing Surges to restore missing wounds. At the end of your long rest you regain 3 healing surges. If you have missing spell slots you restore up to 3 + your level in slots, starting with the lowesr level slots and working your way up. Any talents or items that can only be used a limited number of times per long rest are restored.

#### Exhaustion

### Conditions
Conditions are negative effects that can be given a multitude of ways. Maneuvers, spells, and other abilities can inflict these conditions on players and creatures alike. While you can have multiple conditions effecting you at once, you can't have two of the same condition effecting your character. For example, if you're already Poisoned, getting poisoned again doesn't double its effect.

#### Blind
A Blind creature can't see and adds 2 Purple dice to any attacks or Body rolls.

#### Dazed
A Dazed creature can't take reactions and grants combat advantage to attackers.

#### Feared
A Feared creature adds 1 Bad die to all of their rolls (Except Mind saves) and can't move closer to the source of their fear.

#### Grappled
A Grappled creature can't move and automatically fails Body saving throws.

#### Hexxed
A Hexxed creature removes the first crit rolled from any dice roll they make. It does not count to your rolls total.

#### Incapacitated
An Incapacitated creature can't take any actions and fails all Body rolls.

#### Paralyzed
A paralyzed creature can't sprint and only gains half of their AP each turn.

#### Poisoned
A Poisoned creature adds 2 Bad dice to all attacks, skill checks, and saving throws.

#### Slowed
A Slowed creature has -1 to their move speed and doesn't add their Body score to their sprint speed.

#### Staggered
A Staggered creature grants combat advantage to attackers.

#### Stunned
A Stunned creature can't taky any actions, automatically fails Body rolls, and grants combat advantage to attackers.
