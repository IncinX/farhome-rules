## Your Character

### Attributes
Your character is governed by 4 core numbers called attributes. These define how strong, smart, or resilient your character is and are used in almost every roll. By default the highest your Attribute scores can go is 5, but items or other effects can increase this.

##### Body
Body is a measure of how physically capable you are. Body covers everything from how fast you can run, how much you can carry, and how strong you are.

##### Mind
Mind represents your mental ability and your ability to cast spells. Mind covers everything from how perceptive you are, how much you know about nature, the world and magic, to how skilled you are at casting spells.

##### Stamina
Stamina is a measure of your body's constitution. Stamina covers how your body resists poisons and disease, how many hits you can take in combat, or how easy you are to get tired. Each point of Stamina increases your max wounds by 1.

##### Charisma
Charisma represents your force of personality. Charisma covers how well you can persuade others, how good you are at performing or playing an instrument, even how skilled you are at casting divine spells.

### Skills and Saving Throws
Eventually you will need to roll some dice, and some of the most common rolls are Skill Checks and Saving Throws. Each attribute has a related Skill Check and Saving Throw. Skill Checks are used when you are trying to do something related to that attribute. For example, trying to climb a wall, break down a door, or lift a heavy boulder would all fall under a Body skill check. Saving throws are made when something happens to your character. For example, diving out of the way to avoid a trap would be a Body saving throw, or resisting the poison from a poison dart would be a Stamina saving throw.

### Weapons and Spells
In addition to skill checks and saving throws, you also have attack and spellcasting rolls. Attack rolls are split into two different categories, melee attacks and ranged attacks. Melee attacks are everything from swinging a sword to using your fists to hitting something with a big two handed hammer. Ranged attacks cover all ranged weapons, such as bows, crossbows, to even throwing a javelin or dagger. All attacks are based on your Body attribute.

Spellcasting is divided into two schools: Arcane spells and Divine spells. Arcane spells cover everything from shooting fire from your fingertips, turning people into frogs, creating illusions, or even teleporting to a new place. All Arcane spells use Mind as its attribute. Divine spells cover spells that heal, protect from or remove bad effects, to destroying undead or monstrous creatures. Divine spells use Charisma as its attribute.

### Proficiency
While attributes represent your raw potential in a given area, proficiency represents your training and how skilled you are in those tasks. When your character gains a level they gain a proficiency point they can spend on making skills, saving throws, attacks or spellcasting better. You don't gain any benefit from proficiency scores higher than your attribute score for a given roll. For example, if your Body attribute is 2, having 3 or more proficiency in Body skill checks give no additional benefit.

### Determining Rolls
There are a few things that determine which dice, and how many you roll. For rolls based on an Attribute (such as skills, saving throws, attacks, spells, etc) you will choose from 5 different dice, listed from best to worst:

- **Yellow (Superior)**
- **Green (Skill)**
- **White (Normal)**
- **Red (Bad)**
- **Purple (Terrible)**

For attribute rolls, you start with 5 White dice. For every point of the relevant Attribute, such as Body for Body skill checks, you replace one White die with a Green die. After that, for every point of proficiency you replace a Green die with a Yellow die. If you don't have any Green dice to replace any remaining proficiency points have no effect.

>Lets look at an example Body skill check with 3 Body and 2 proficiency.

>| Base | W | W | W | W | W |
>| Attributes | G | G | G | W | W |
>| Proficiency | Y | Y | G | W | W |
>| End | Y | Y | G | W | W |

In some cases you might have more than 5 for your attribute score. This is possible through talents or items, and when making rolls with a score above 5 you add White dice for every attribute score above 5 you have. Proficiency replaces extra dice added to Green dice instead of Yellow.

### Creating a Character
You start by choosing a race. Your race determines a handful of your starting stats, such as your move speed, your starting wounds, a talent, and modifiers to your attribute scores. Once you have a race, it's best to determine your attributes next. Your attributes start at 0, adding any bonuses or negatives from your race. After that you get 4 points to add across all your attributes. The only limitation is that you cannot have an attribute greater than 3.

Next, pick a background. Backgrounds are special talents that give you a variety of stats and starting gear and determines what talents are available to your character. Finally you get 4 proficiency points to put into any of your skills. When adding proficiency to an attribute it increases both the skill check and saving throw proficiencies for that attribute.

### Leveling up
Eventually your characters will have progressed far enough to grow in strength, which is represented by your level. The max level is 10, with each level giving you a number of bonuses. Each time you level up you gain the following:

- Your max wounds increases by 1
- You gain 1 proficiency point
- You choose a new talent

In addition, some backgrounds effect what you gain when leveling up, such as getting new spell slots or abilities.

#### Attribute Score Increase
Starting at level 2 and every 2 levels after, when leveling up you increase one of your attribute scores by 1, up to a maximum of 5.

#### Action Point Increase
At levels 4, 7, and 10 your action point max increases by 1.
