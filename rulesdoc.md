# Preface

What once started as a series of homebrew rules has turned into a full fledged rule book. Inside this book is a set of rules that many of you will be familiar with. Anyone who's played a fantasy tabletop roleplaying game has probably rolled dice to hit a goblin, made an athletics check to kick down a door, or cast an iconic fireball into a crowd of monsters. The rules in this book describe an alternate way to play the same game we've been playing for ages, one that hopefully gives a simplified, more engaging experience that offers players more _freedom_ with their characters. And _fun_, because I wouldn't be writing this if I didn't have fun playing it.

There are a few things here you won't find elsewhere, however. There are **no classes** in Farhome. Instead you are given a blank slate. **Backgrounds** help define who your character was before becoming an adventurer, leaving how they grow and advance up to you. Combat has been streamlined with **action points**, giving you more options in playing your turn. Dice rolls are always **contested** by either the GM or another player, keeping the game active and engaging. Dice rolls also use a **success/failure** system instead of adding numbers, with failure (and success!) always being a possibility.

While many things have been simplified, there's still loads of depth in these rules. They offer more ways to be creative with your characters and their actions, providing opportunities for teamwork while still giving each character their space to shine. Which is neat.

## What is Farhome?

Farhome is a tabletop role playing system set in a fantasy world of magic, monsters, and adventures. You and a group of friends play as adventurers, exploring and interacting with a world created by another one of your friends, the Game Master. While the rules in the book give structure to how your adventurers interact with the world, largely the game is driven by you and your friends imaginations. 

You won't find any rules in this book about what you need to roll to climb up an ogre's back, but that doesn't mean your adventurer can't try. For every scenario that isn't handled by the book it's ultimately up to the Game Master to decide how it happens, or if it's possible. In this respect the players work together with the Game Master; the players describing the actions they want to take and the Game Master describing the outcome of those actions and how the world responds.

At the end of the day Farhome is a game about creativity, imagination, and having fun with your friends. It is a _collaborative_ experience, working with the Game Master to tell a story. With that being said you can expect to experience the following:
- battle goblins and orcs
- delve into dangerous dungeons
- find wondrous treasures, magical trinkets, or ancient weapons
- explore an ancient wode, a scorching desert, or the depths below the mountains
- meet noble kings and nefarious villains
- solve challenging puzzles and avoid deadly traps
- come to an untimely death
- roll a lot of dice along the way
  
## How to Play

Before you begin, you and your friends will need to determine who will be the Game Master. The Game Master (or GM) is in charge of the world, handling all the locations, monsters, and people in the world, while everyone else is in charge of an adventurer, or character. Usually the GM is played by the same person every game, but in some games it makes sense to rotate that responsibility. Regardless, the GM acts as the main story teller, or referee. If there's ever any confusion as to how something works, or if the players want to do something that this book doesn't cover the GM has the final say on what happens.

Farhome follows a narrative gameplay loop: the GM begins by describing the environment the adventurers are in, the players describe what they want their adventurers do, and finally the GM describes the results of those actions. This is the core of the game and is seen in every aspect of the game. For example the GM could be describing the dungeon your group of adventurers are exploring, giving the players a basic set of actions they could follow (the layout of the room, how many doors there are, if the adventurers see any creatures, and so on). The players then tell the GM what they want their characters to do, such as opening a door, searching for traps, or attacking a monster. The GM then describes the results of their actions: the door may be locked, or they find a poison dart trap, or surprise the monster. This often leads to another choice for the players, which starts the narrative loop all over again. This gameplay loop continues whether the players are exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters, or investigating for clues in a town.

Each time your group meets to play you can expect to spend 2-3 hours playing. During this time you can reasonably expect to: meet and interact with a notable non-player character (or NPC), explore a new location, fight dangerous monsters, and find something memorable. While some sessions you might never interact with an NPC, or encounter any monsters, it's these 4 experiences that build an adventure.

Adventures usually have a distinct beginning and end. As an example an adventure may require you to save a village from monsters. You will need to talk to the villagers and gather information about whats attacking them. The villagers may tell you the monsters live in the forest outside town, which you will need to explore. On finding the monsters lair you come up with a plan to defeat it, and after defeating it return to the village where they reward you with a magical sword. Your group may finish an adventure in a single session, or it might take many sessions, spanning many locations, people, and monsters.

When one adventure ends, another can begin. This string of quests and adventures is called a campaign. Campaigns can span months or years, with each adventure adding to one large story. Your character might die over the course of the campaign, either at the hand of a dangerous monster, villain, or any manner of way. You friends might search for a way to revive you, or you might create a new character. Over the course of the campaign your group may fail,or everyone may meet their demise. Even so, at the end of the day a successful campaign is one where everyone is able to have a good time, regardless of if your characters 'win' or 'lose'.


With that out of the way, how exactly do you start playing Farhome? Well, that part is fairly easy. The following pages describe everything from rolling dice, creating a character, and how combat works. With this you and your friends should be able to create a group of adventurers ready to explore a new and exciting world.

## GM Quick Start Guide

Creating a world of infinite possibilities can seem like a daunting task, and well, that's because it is. This book is woefully lax in guidelines on how to run the game, but I can at least get you started and out the door. Thankfully that won't take much, as while the world is infinite the space the characters are interacting with is tiny and constrained. For now anyways, more on that later.

To start, you'll need a minimum of 3 things: A town, a dungeon, and an obstacle for the players to overcome. Your players have to start somewhere in your world, and that place is usually a town. You don't need much for a town, a few names for the people living there, a tavern for players to meet them, and 1 or 2 places for your players to interact with, such as the mayors house or blacksmith.

Next is a dungeon. It doesn't have to be a literal dungeon, it could be an abandoned temple, a cave, or the lair of some ferocious beast. Whatever it is, it should be big enough for the players to explore, but not too big to get lost in. This usually means 2 or 3 rooms or 'encounters'. Your dungeon may have traps to prevent entry, or be filled with hostile creatures, or both! It needs something that adds challenge and danger for your players when they explore it. It also needs a reward for completing it. A magic item held by the strongest creature in the dungeon, or some treasure hidden behind the most dangerous traps.

Finally we need a reason for the players to explore the dungeon, the obstacle. This can be anything that motivates your players, for example the blacksmiths daughter was kidnapped and is being held there, it could contain a cure for a disease plaguing the town (and now players!), or it even could be a rumor of treasure. The obstacle serves to tie the town to the dungeon in a way that motivates the players. The players learn about the obstacle in the town, and head to the dungeon to overcome it.

With those 3 things you have your first adventure and are ready to run your first game. Making your second adventure will be easier than your first, you already have the town after all. As your game progresses, so does the world you created, adding other towns and villages as you need them. Maybe this land is ruled by a king, or some fiendish villain is plotting against the players behind the scenes.

As your players experience your world they'll eventually want to branch out. They may get access to spells making travel easier, want to seek out that dastardly villain, or just want to explore. Eventually you'll need a big world for them to explore, but all of that starts with a town, a dungeon, and an obstacle.

# Playing The Game

### Rolling Dice

Farhome uses a set of 6-sided dice to determine outcomes. There are 9 types of 6-sided dice, each with their own layout of successes or failures. With most dice rolls you roll a set of dice determined by your characters skills or abilities, adding challenge dice depending on the difficulty of the task. Rolling more successes than failures means your action succeeded. Sometimes your roll is contested by another characters roll. In these cases ties always go to the defender.

Some dice have special symbols on them for Critical Successes and Critical Failures. These count as 2 successes and 2 failures respectively as well as adding or removing a critical. Defense dice work similarly to the other dice, having defense symbols instead of successes. Finally wound dice are used to determine damage, healing, or in some cases chance.

### Calculating a Roll
After making a roll add up all your successes and critical successes, negating any failures and critical failures. Keep in mind that critical rolls count as both 2 successes and a critical. For example, 2 failures can negate the successes from a critical success, but it doesn't remove the critical part of that roll. Some abilities allow you to reroll dice or change the result of a die which can change the outcome of your roll. Almost every roll is contested by either the GM adding challenge dice to your roll or by another creatures roll. The roll is a success if you have more successes than your opponent, with ties favoring the defender if there is one, or the most neutral action

Remember that rolls contested by a creature can change the outcome of your roll. The defenders criticals negate any criticals you have in your roll. For example, if you have more total successes than the opponents roll, but they rolled more criticals than you, the action succeeds but does not trigger any critical effects.

#### Determining What Dice to Roll
With the exception of defense rolls, your attributes and proficiencies determine what dice you roll. Defense rolls use defense and superior defense dice, while other rolls use superior, enhanced, normal, bad, and terrible dice. Wound dice are used to determine how much damage an action does, such as hitting a goblin with a sword or casting the _Firebolt_ spell.

Rolls that use your attributes roll dice depending on your attribute and proficiency scores, with different skills using different attributes and proficiencies. For example, attacking with melee weapons uses your Strength attribute and has a different proficiency score depending on if your using a one-handed or two-handed weapon. For attribute rolls you start with 5 normal dice. For every attribute point you have replace a normal die with an enhanced die. Next, for every proficiency point you have, replace an enhanced die with a superior die. Proficiency does not replace normal dice, therefore you only benefit from a proficiency score equal to or less than your attribute score.

In the case where you have a negative number for your attribute score, replace a normal die with a bad die. If your proficiency score is negative, replace an enhanced die with a normal die, or a bad die with a terrible die.

Through feats, spells, or items you may have an attribute score greater than 5. In this case for every attribute score above 5 you have you add a normal die, replacing it with an enhanced die for every proficiency score above 5.

#### Defense Rolls
Defense rolls use defense and superior defense dice. The number and type of dice you roll is determined by what armor your wearing. You roll 2 defense dice while not wearing armor, instead rolling the armors dice value if you have armor equipped. Holding a shield adds either a defense or superior defense die, depending on the shield.

#### Attribute Saves
Attribute saves use the same rules as rolling a skill with one exception: negative attribute scores do not replace normal dice with bad dice. This means that the lowest you can roll is 5 normal dice. However, other effects, such as being poisoned, still add dice. In almost every case when you roll an attribute save you are seen as the defender, with the roll siding in your favor on a tie.

In some cases your GM may ask you to make a raw attribute roll. Rolling a raw attribute uses your attribute save proficiency and is effected by negative scores.

#### Wound Dice
Many attacks and spells deal wounds or wound dice to their targets. When an attack says it deals wound dice you roll that many wound dice, dealing damage based on the number of wounds rolled. For example, a spell that deals 1 wound and 2 wound dice in damage will deal 1 wound, adding the result of the 2 wound dice in damage to the target.

#### Hero Dice
Hero dice are special dice players can add to any roll. Depending on the GM, you'll gain a number of them at the start of your adventure and once spent are not replenished. You can add at most 1 hero die to any roll, except wound rolls, and you may choose to add a hero dice after you have rolled. Hero dice are immune to any effects that would change the outcome of the roll, it cannot be hexed, rerolled, or negated.

Your GM may reward you with extra hero dice during your adventure, but hero dice are usually only given at the start of each adventure.

#### Skill Challenges
Skill challenges are rarely made in contest, instead the GM will ask you to add dice depending on the challenge of the task you are trying to accomplish. Each skill has its own proficiency score and uses one of your attributes to determine dice. For example, an athletics check will use your Strength score while an acrobatics check will use your Dexterity score.

The outcome in these rolls isn't always a strict pass or fail. Depending on the GM they may give a bonus if you roll a critical success or something bad may happen if you roll a critical fail. For skill challenges the character is always considered the _attacker_, with a tie or a final result of 0 counting as a fail.

#### Helping in Skill Challenges
In some cases you may want to help someone with an action, such as trying to push a boulder or search a room. When helping every participant rolls the same skill check and is contested by a single challenge roll. The highest roll among the participants is used, adding a success for every critical rolled by others.

##### Skill Challenge Difficulty

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|:----:|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Simple  | B | _ | _ | _ | _ | _ | _ |
| Easy  | B | B | _ | _ | _ | _ | _ |
| Average | B | B | T | _ | _ | _ | _ |
| Hard | B | B | T | T | _ | _ | _ |
| Difficult | B | B | B | T | T | T | _ |
| Impossible | B | B | T | T | T | T | T |

#### Rerolls
Either through expertise, feats, or other abilities you may reroll a number of dice when making a roll. When rerolling you may choose any dice, except wound dice, to reroll, taking the new value instead. Once rerolled you may not reroll the same die again. You may reroll any dice that are considered part of your roll, such as bonus dice from upcasting a spell, dice added from abilities or spells such as _Guidance_, and dice given by negative effects, such as poison. When making a skill challenge, all challenge dice are considered part of your roll and may be rerolled. 

Dice rolled in contest of your own roll, such as another creatures defend or saving throw, cannot be rerolled by you. Additionally, dice that have been replaced, such as dice that have been hexed, cannot be rerolled.

#### Adding Dice
Some abilities allow you to add dice to certain rolls. Dice that are added as part of upcasting a spell or from abilities that apply to your next roll must be added and rolled together. Hero dice, or abilities that allow you to add dice to any roll within a timeframe can be added after your roll, but before the outcome is determined.

For example, dice added from the spells _Guidance_ or _Weal_ add dice to your next roll that satisfies the condition. These dice must be added the next time you make that roll. Dice added by the _Inspiring Words_ maneuver can be added to any roll made in the timeframe. If you wanted to add _Inspiring Words_ to your attack, you may wait to see the opponents defense before adding the superior die. Similarly, your opponent can wait to see your attack roll before deciding to add dice to their defense roll.

### Wounds

Wounds are used to determine how hard a character is to kill, the more wounds you have the more durable your character. Wounds are lost when you are hit by attacks, spells, or traps and are restored by taking rests or through certain spells.

#### Lesser and Greater Wounds

Some abilities or spells inflict lesser or greater wounds. These do not deal damage, but do leave lasting effects. Lesser wounds can be cured through magic and after each long rest you choose a single lesser wound to remove. Greater wounds can be difficult to cure by magic. Each week that you have a greater wound you make a Stamina save against 3 terrible dice, removing a single greater wound on success. Some greater wounds, such as losing an arm, cannot be healed naturally.

#### Temporary Wounds

Some abilities give temporary wounds instead of healing missing wounds. When taking damage you remove any temporary wounds first, dealing any remaining damage to your wounds. Once lost, temporary wounds do not come back and cannot be healed, however whenever you gain new temporary wounds you add them to your total. You may have a maximum of half your health, rounded up, in temporary wounds at any given time.

### Action Points

Action points (AP) are used during combat to move, attack, or cast spells. Each turn you refill your pool of action points up to its max. Aside from a few actions (listed in the Combat section) there is no limit on which actions you can take on your turn. Any unspent action points can be spent on reactions when it's not your turn. Reactions are triggered by specific actions other creatures take. For example, opportunity attacks can only be made when a creature tries to leave your zone of control.

### Death Saves

When a character takes enough damage to bring them to 0 wounds they fall unconscious and start making death saves. While unconscious you gain temporary wounds equal to half your total wounds rounded up. At the start of each turn you roll a wound die, losing 1 of your temporary wounds if the die rolls a wound. If you lose all of your temporary wounds your character dies.

Death saves aren't the only way you can lose temporary wounds. Creatures can still make attacks against you and any melee attacks that hit you deal full damage regardless of the wound dice rolled. Likewise, allies can attempt to bring you back with healing spells, potions, or by stabilizing you. While in this state healing effects restore any lost temporary wounds first. If this brings you 1 wound or above you regain consciousness and no longer make death saves.

You can attempt to stabilize a character by making a medicine check. The check takes 10 AP and you must be beside the downed character to make it. Roll a medicine check, adding a terrible die for every temporary wound the character is missing. On success the character is stabilized, with failure restoring a temporary wound for every critical success in your medicine check. A stabilized players's wounds are set to 1 and they no longer make death saving throws, gaining consciousness after 10 minutes.

### Maneuvers

Maneuvers are special abilities that can be learned by your character. They can be learned by anyone, but most maneuvers require a weapon to be used. Using a maneuver is the same as taking any other action during your turn, however they have the following restrictions:

- You may only use one maneuver per turn, reaction maneuvers excluded.
- You cannot use the same maneuver two consecutive rounds in a row.

Most maneuvers have weapon requirements, or can only be used in specific situations, such as when an ally is attacked. Each maneuver has a level requirement which is shown as two levels, the first being the level at which you learn the maneuver and the second being the level it becomes **enhanced**. When your character reaches the maneuver's enhanced level it gains the effects described in its **enhanced** textblock.

### Healing Surge

Healing surges are used to heal wounds your character has suffered and are spent during a short or long rest. Your character starts with healing surges equal to your Stamina score (minimum of 1) and gains an extra healing surge every 10 levels. When spending a healing surge you roll 3 wound dice, healing for the number of wounds rolled. You can spend any number of healing surges during a short or long rest. After each long rest you regain up to 3 of your spent healing surges.

### Combat Advantage

Some abilities may impose combat advantage against you or an enemy. Someone who grants combat advantage is easier to hit, giving anyone who makes an attack, maneuver, or spell attack against the creature an extra superior die to their roll.

### Attributes
Your characters aptitude is represented by 6 core attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Stamina, Intelligence, Willpower, and Charisma. Each attribute governs a number of skills in addition to the following:

#### Strength
Each point of Strength improves your melee attacks.

#### Dexterity
Each point of Dexterity improves your ranged attacks, attacks with melee weapons with the _finesse_ property, and how far you can sprint.

#### Stamina
Each point of Stamina increases your max wounds by 1.

#### Intelligence
Each point of Intelligence improves your arcane spellcasting ability.

#### Willpower
Each point of Willpower improves your curse spellcasting ability.

#### Charisma
Each point of Charisma improves your divine spellcasting ability.


# Proficiency
</br>
Proficiency is a measure of how capable your character is at a given skill or task. Every skill, weapon type, spell school, tool, and attribute save have their own proficiency score which can be increased as your character grows. With the exception of spell proficiencies, there is no limit on how many skills you can be proficient in. You may only increase spell proficiencies if you have the appropriate background or feat.


### Skills

Skills represent how good your character is at completing different tasks and actions. Each skill has an associated attribute and its own proficiency modifier. There are no restrictions for which skills a player can add proficiency for, however you gain no benefit for proficiency scores above your attribute score.

| Enchanters Tools | Intelligence |
| Scribing Tools | Intelligence |

### Expertise

Some feats or abilities grant you expertise in a specific skill or action. When making a roll you have expertise in you may reroll 3 dice, taking the new values.


### Attribute Saves

Every attribute has an associated attribute save. Attribute saves are a measure of how resistant your character is to various effects. Attribute saves are almost always _reactionary_, with your character making the save in response to an action something else takes. For example, someone trying to shove you would make a roll against your Strength save, or dodging a trap would roll against your Dexterity save.

### Spell Schools

There are 3 schools of magic: arcane, curse, and divine. Each school uses its own proficiency score and you must be trained in the spell school before you can add to them. Training can come from background feats, basic feats, or during character creation.

### Weapons

Weapons are split between simple and martial weapons. Simple weapons can be used by anyone and don't use their own proficiency modifier. Instead you use the relevant martial proficiency. When using a martial weapon that you don't have proficiency with you add 1 terrible die to the attack roll.

Weapon proficiencies are split between 4 categories: One Handed, Two Handed, Ranged, and Unarmed. By default melee weapons and unarmed use Strength while ranged weapons use Dexterity, but this can changed based on the weapon. For example a weapon with the _finesse_ property can use Dexterity for its attribute, while weapons with _Thrown_ can use Strength when used as a ranged weapon.

# Spells
</br>

Spells are split into 3 schools of magic: arcane, curse, and divine. Each school handles a different type of magic and uses a different attribute for its spellcasting. Arcane spells use the elements and raw power to defeat their foes, using Intelligence for its attribute. Curse spells inflict curses and maladies to their targets and uses Willpower. Divine spells center around healing and empowering targets and uses Charisma.

To cast a spell you must have a codex containing the spell you want to cast, have the spell prepared, and have enough mana to cast the spell.

### Codexes

Very few creatures are able to innately cast magic. Almost everyone must prepare spells they've written into a spellbook, or codex. There is no limit on the school, level, or type of spell you can hold in your codex. New spells can be added to your codex by copying spells from spell scrolls or a codex. This process is destructive, and destroys the scroll or codex after a spell is copied.

___
>**Variant Rule - Spells from Codexes**
>
>In some games spells may be limited, or codexes a rare occurrence. With this variant when copying a spell from a codex, instead of destroying the codex you make an arcana check against 2 bad dice. On success the codex is not destroyed. Copying a spell removes the spell from the codex.

### Mana

Casting spells of 1st level and above takes a toll on the caster. A character can only cast so many of these spells before needing to rest. Mana is a representation of your characters magical energy and how efficiently they are able to channel that energy. When casting a spell at 1st level or above you expend a number of mana according to the following table:

| Spell Level | Mana |
|:----:|:-------------:|
| 1st-4th | Spell level |
| 5th  | 6 |
| 6th  | 8 |
| 7th  | 10 |
| 8th  | 13 |
| 9th  | 16 |
| 10th | 20 |

### Spell Power
Spell power determines how attuned your body is to spellcasting and how easy it is to increase your mana, or magical energy. When your character levels up you may choose to increase your mana based on your spell power. By default your spell power is equal to your characters level, and can be increased through leveling up or through feats.

### Preparing Spells

Before you can cast a spell from your codex you must prepare it. Each long rest you may prepare 5 spells, adding 3 for every point of Intelligence you have. Having negative Intelligence does not reduce the number of spells you can prepare. Once prepared, spells are castable until the next day even without your codex. The spells fade from your memory over the next long rest unless you prepare them again.

### Casting Spells

Each spell has either an AP cost or a time given as its casting time. There is no limit to the number of spells you can cast a turn as long as you have the AP to do so. Casting a spell that lists a time instead of AP can still be used in combat, but requires the casting time worth of full turns. For example casting a spell with a cast time of 1 minute requires 3 full turns to cast.

All spells, including cantrips, can be cast at a higher level to increase its potency. When casting at a higher level you spend mana equal to the level your casting at, not the spells base level. Casting spells this way gives additional effects listed in the spell.

Depending on your character's level you will only be able to cast spells up to a certain level. The table blow shows the maximum level your character can cast based on their level.

| Player Level | Spell Level |
|:----:|:----:|
| 1st  | 1st |
| 3rd  | 2nd |
| 6th | 3rd |
| 9th | 4th |
| 12th | 5th |
| 15th | 6th |
| 18th | 7th |
| 21st | 8th |
| 24th | 9th |
| 27th | 10th |

___
>#### Variant Rule - Attribute Based Spell Levels
>
>With this rule, instead of your spell level being determined by your level it is determined by your attribute for a given spell school. Your max spell level for arcane spells is based on your Intelligence, curse spells based on your Willpower, and divine spells based on your Charisma. This means an exceptionally intelligent caster could cast high level spells at an early level- if they have the mana and spell prepared.
>
>Your max spell level is determined on the chart below:
>
>| Attribute Score | Spell Level |
>|:----:|:----:|
>| 0 or Less  | Cantrip |
>| 1  | 1st |
>| 2  | 2nd |
>| 3  | 3rd-4th |
>| 4  | 5th-6th |
>| 5  | 7th-8th |
>| 6+  | 9th-10th |

### Concentration

Some spells require concentration to maintain its effects. You may only concentrate on a single spell at a time and casting a new spell with concentration will end the effects of the previous spell. When you take damage while concentrating on a spell you make a Stamina save against a bad die and adding a bad die for every wound taken from the attack. On failure you lose concentration and the spell ends.

### Cantrips

Cantrips are spells that do not require mana to cast, but must still be prepared like the rest of your spells. For casting at a higher level, cantrips are considered level 0 spells and gain benefits when cast at 1st level or above.


___
>#### Variant Rule - Misfires
>
>While anyone can cast any spell, trying to cast a spell beyond your abilities can lead to a misfire. When casting a spell beyond your ability, either normally or through upcasting a spell, you add 1 terrible die to the spellcasting roll for every rank beyond your ability. If you do not have any remaining successes before contesting with another roll the spell misfires. Roll on the misfire chart to determine the effect.

# Creating a Character
</br>
Creating a character is simple. To start, choose a race for your character. The race determines your starting wounds, how far you can move or sprint, and your starting attribute bonuses. Each race has a unique feat that all people of that race share. 

After picking a race, choose a background feat for your character. These are unique feats that can only be chosen during character creation and determine what kind of skills or abilities your character had before becoming an adventurer.

Next, assign your attribute scores. You start with a -1 to all attribute scores, adding any bonuses from your race. You get 9 points you can arrange across your attributes. At this stage characters can have a max attribute score of 3, with 5 being the maximum you can increase an attribute from leveling up.

You have 4 proficiency points to spend on your skills and saving throws. If you have a background or feat that gives you proficiency in a spell school you may increase your spellcasting proficiency.

Finally, choose 2 starting bonuses.

##### Starting Bonuses
- Increase an attribute score by 1, up to a max of 3
- Get training in a spell school and gain 1 proficiency score in that spell school
- Gain 5 proficiency points
- Learn a feat
- Learn a maneuver and gain 2 proficiency score with a weapon type
- Increase your max wounds by 1
- Increase your spell power by 5 and gain 3 mana

___
>**Variant Rule - Rolling for Attributes**
>
>Instead of using the normal rules for attributes, your group may decide to roll your scores. For each attribute roll 1 superior, 2 normal, and 1 terrible die, adding up the total successes.

___
>**Variant Rule - Group Rolls**
>
>Many people prefer the randomness given by rolling for attributes, but this can often lead to very powerful or weak characters across a group. As a way to ensure every player is on the same level, each player takes turns rolling an attribute score. Once 6 scores have been rolled the players use those scores to create their characters. The players can place the scores in any attribute they want, but they must use the same 6 scores as every other player.

### Starting Equipment
Depending on your background you may start with additional gear. All players start with an adventuring kit containing a bedroll, 10 days of rations, a fire kit and 50ft of rope. In addition you start with 50 silver crosses which you can spend on gear or upgrades. Any unspent silver becomes your characters starting money.

#### Currency
Currency in Farhome is divided into 3 types: the copper trite, silver cross, and platinum talent. A silver cross is worth 100 copper trites, and a platinum talent is worth 100 silver crosses.

|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Upgrade |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 5sc  | Any simple weapon |
| 10sc | Cantrip or Level 1 Spell |
| 10sc | Basic Healing Potion |
| 10sc | Buckler |
| 15sc | Padded or studded armor |
| 15sc | Any martial weapon |
| 20sc | Upgrading armor to the next type |
| 30sc | A repair kit, apothecary set, enchanters tools, or scribing tools |

### Leveling Up

When you earn 1000 experience your character levels up. Each level you gain 1 proficiency point and choose one of the following bonuses:

- Gain 3 spell power, then gain mana based on your spell power
- Gain 3 proficiency points
- Gain a feat
- Learn a maneuver
- Increase your max wounds by 1

##### Mana

When gaining mana, you apply the spell power gained from leveling up before increasing your mana based on the table below.

| Spell Power | Mana Gained |
|:----:|:----:|
| 1-8  | 3 |
| 9-18  | 4 |
| 19-28 | 5 |
| 29-40 | 7 |
| 41-55 | 9 |
| 56-70 | 12 |
| 70+ | 15 |


##### Attribute Score increase

Starting at level 3, every 3 levels you increase an attribute score by 1, up to a max of 5.

##### Action Points

Your max action points increases by 1 at levels 10, 20 and 30.

##### Max Wounds Increase

Your max wounds increases by 1 at levels 7, 14, 21, and 28.

#### Earning Experience
Players earn experience after every encounter based on the difficulty of the encounter. Experience is earned based on how difficult it is for the players to overcome the encounter, not by how much experience an individual monster gives.

##### Healing Surges

Your max healing surges increases by 1 at levels 10, 20, and 30.


##### Encounters
| Difficulty | Experience | CR level |
|:----:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Easy  | 50-100 | 75% Party Level |
| Average  | 100-150 | Party Level |
| Hard | 150-250 | 125% Party Level |
| Deadly | 250-500 | 150% Party Level |

___
>**Variant - Milestones**
>An alternative to experience is milestones. Experience can in some cases be hard to keep consistent across adventures. With milestones you gain a level after completing an adventure, or at set points during the adventure.


# Adventuring
</br>
As an adventurer you'll be spending just as much time travelling to and from the dungeon as you will delving its depths. Even the most battle hardened adventurers need to rest from time to time. Resting comes in two forms: short and long rests. Each day you can take at most two short rests and one long rest. Taking any more than that has no effect.

### Travelling

A normal travelling day is 8 hours, with travel speed varying greatly based on the terrain. You can push yourself to travel for longer at risk of gaining exhaustion. For every extra hour you spend travelling you make an exhaustion roll. Starting against 2 bad dice, you add 1 terrible die every time you make this roll this day. On failure you gain 1 level of exhaustion and cannot travel further.

Travelling with a mount makes travel easier, removing most of the strain of travel. However, while travelling is easier for you, most mounts won't spend more than 8 hours a day in travel. If your mount has the ability to fly you do not take any penalties to travel based on the terrain.

##### Travel Speed
|  | Type | Miles per Day |
|:----:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| _Terrain_  |  |  |
|  | Road | 16 |
|  | Plains, Forest | 12 |
|  | Mountain, Swamp | 8 |
| _Mounts_ | | |
|  | Horse, Mule | +2 |
|  | War Horse | +4 |
|  | Exotic | +2-8 |

### Short Rests

Short rests require an hour of uninterrupted rest to complete. During a short rest you may spend any number of healing surges to restore lost wounds. You regain mana equal to half your character's level, rounded up, with a minimum of 1. You only get the benefits of a short rest if you are able to complete it. Taking other actions, such as brewing a potion, breaks your rest.

### Long Rests

Long rests require 8 hours of rest with at most 2 hours of non-strenuous activity, such as keeping watch, preparing spells, or brewing potions. You automatically recover 1 wound and 3 healing surges over a long rest, and you may spend any number of healing surges to restore wounds. You regain mana equal to 3 + your character's level, recover 1 point of exhaustion, and end the effect of one lesser wound. If you go more than 24 hours without taking a long rest you must make an exhaustion roll against 2 bad dice and 1 terrible die. You make this check every 24 hours without a long rest.

When taking a long rest in the wilderness you must light a fire and make camp to gain the full benefits. To start a fire, make an average difficulty survival check. Depending on your location this roll may be easier or harder. On failure, instead of the normal benefits you regain 1 healing surge and restore mana equal to half your character's level. You may still spend any number of healing surges during this rest.

### Exhaustion
All adventurers need to rest from time to time, trying to do too much in a day can leave you exhausted. You can gain exhaustion from many situations, from travelling too long, not taking rests, spells, or abilities. You lose a level of exhaustion after every long rest. At 6 levels of exhaustion your character drops dead.

##### Exhaustion Levels
| Level | All Proficiencies | Max Wounds | Sprint
|:----:|:----:|:----:|:-------------|
| 1  | -1 | -1 | Yes |
| 2  | -1 | -2 | Yes |
| 3 | -2 | -3 | No |
| 4 | -2 | -4 | No |
| 5 | -3 | -5 | No |


# Combat
</br>
There will be times when combat is unavoidable. Your adventurer may encounter zombies in an underground crypt, or be ambushed by a group of bandits. When this happens every creature participating in combat rolls for initiative. Once initiative order has been set, each creature takes a turn. Once every creature has had a turn the round ends and a new one begins starting with the first creature. Each round lasts 20 seconds.

### Initiative

When combat starts every character and creature in combat rolls for initiative. By default you roll 5 normal dice, replacing 1 with an enhanced die for every point of Dexterity you have. Negative Dexterity converts normal dice to bad dice instead. You add a flat success/failure modifier depending on the circumstances. Surprised creatures start with 3 failures. These values can be changed by feats or skills, and other dice may be added.

Combatants take turns, starting with whoever rolled the highest initiative and ending with whoever rolled the lowest. After every combatant has had a turn the round ends and a new round begins. This repeats until combat is over or one side has defeated all other combatants.

### On your turn

Each turn your action points are refilled. You can spend any amount of AP on your turn and any unused AP can be used on reactions during the rest of the round. You gain no benefit for any unspent AP when your turn comes again.

##### Attack (5 AP)
Make a weapon attack against a creature. The actual damage, range, and effects of an attack depend on the weapon used in the attack. Unarmed attacks use Strength and deal a wound die in damage.

To make an attack you make an attack roll against the creatures defense. If you have more successes than the targets defense you hit, with ties favoring the defender and counting as a miss.

##### Grapple
Instead of making an attack you can attempt to grapple a creature. Make an athletics check, with the target choosing to make either a Dexterity or Strength save. On success you grapple the creature. While grappling a creature your move and sprint speed are reduced to 1 and cannot be increased, however the grappled creature is dragged with you. Anything that changes the AP cost of your attacks also effects grapples. Likewise you may attempt to grapple as many times as you want as long as you have AP and aren't currently grappling anyone.

You may end a grapple at any time. A grappled creature can attempt to free themselves on their turn by spending 5 AP. They make a Strength save against your athletics check, freeing themselves on success.

##### Defend (5 AP)
Until your next turn you reroll 2 dice when making a defense roll, or 3 if you're holding a shield.

##### Move (3 AP, once per turn)
You may move up to your move speed in tiles. Some terrain, such as difficult terrain, requires 2 tiles of movement for every tile you traverse. Movement does not have be done all at once, you can split your movement as many times as you want. For example if you have a movement of 5 you may move 3 tiles, take another action, and then move the remaining 2 tiles.

##### Sprint (2 AP, can only be used after move, once per turn)
You may move up to your sprint speed plus your Dexterity score in tiles. Negative Dexterity has no effect on your sprint speed. Moving while sprinting follows the same rules as the Move action.

##### Reaction Attack (2 AP)
When a creature tries to leave your zone of control you may make a reaction attack against them. You cannot use maneuvers, unless the maneuver says it can be used as a reaction, and the attack uses the same rules as the Attack action.

##### Off-hand Attack (2 AP, can only be used after attack, once per turn)
When dual wielding, as long as you have taken the Attack action you may make an attack with your offhand weapon. This attack is identical to the Attack action, except you do not get any bonus from proficiency.

##### Use (2 AP)
This covers a wide range of actions, from using an item, drinking a potion, activating a magic item, or interacting with an object (eg: pulling a switch). Some magic items will give their own AP costs, using those instead. While there is no limit in how many times a turn you can take the Use action, some items may have restrictions. A creature can only benefit from a single potion each round.

___
>**Variant Rule: Using Potions on Others**
>You can use potions on downed creatures by spending 5 AP instead of 2. Normal potion rules still apply.

##### Spell (Varying AP)
There is no limit to the number of spells you can cast each turn, as long as you have enough AP to cast them. Spells will require you to make a Spellcasting roll against the creatures defense or saving throw, with ties going in favor of the defender.


##### Maneuver (Varying AP)
Maneuvers are special attacks, actions, or reactions your character can learn. You may only use a single maneuver on your turn, and you cannot use the same maneuver two rounds in a row.

##### Ready Action (Varying AP)
There are times you may want to hold your action, waiting for a specific circumstance before you take that action. At any point in your turn you may ready an action. You may only ready a single action and must pay the AP cost for the action immediately. For example, you could ready the _Attack_ action but not both the _Attack_ and _Move_ actions.

To ready an action you must first describe the circumstance that will trigger the action. This can be anything your character can perceive, such as "I want to attack if a goblin moves closer to me" or "I want to cast this spell when an enemy rounds that corner." You must also specify which action you want to take and must have enough AP remaining to take that action. If the circumstance did not happen before your next turn starts you lose the action.

Sometimes more than one readied action could be triggered by the same circumstance. In this case the actions occur in initiative order.

## Conditions
There are a number of conditions that can be inflicted on creatures, each with different effects. Some conditions have a level to determine their potency. For example, the poison condition normally adds a bad die to your attack rolls and saving throws, where poison 2 and poison 3 adds 2 and 3 bad dice respectively.

##### Blind
A blinded creature loses the ability to see. While blind they add 2 terrible die to all attack, spellcasting, and Dexterity saving throws. They cannot make reactions.

##### Dazed
A dazed creature cannot take the Sprint or Reaction actions and grant combat advantage to attackers.

##### Fear
a feared creature cannot willingly move closer to the source of the fear. While the source is within line of sight, they add 1 bad die to any rolls made.

##### Grapple
A grappled creature cannot move or sprint, adds 2 bad dice to Dexterity saving throws, and grants combat advantage to all creatures except the grappler.

##### Hex
When making any roll, a hexed creature replaces a critical with a single success for every level of hex on the creature. For example, a creature with hex 2 will replace the first 2 crits they roll with a single success each.

##### Incapacitated
An incapacitated creature takes no actions and automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.

##### Paralyzed
A paralyzed creature automatically fails Dexterity saving throws. When taking an action they first roll a wound die. If the result is a wound they do not take the action and lose the AP spent.

##### Poison
A poisoned creature adds a bad die to all attacks, saving throws, and ability checks, adding an additional bad die for every level of poison. Only the highest level poison takes effect. For example someone who has poison and poison 2 only adds 2 bad dice instead of 3.

##### Prone
a prone creature grants combat advantage to any melee attacker. Ranged attacks against this creature add 2 bad dice to their roll.

##### Restrained
A restrained creature cannot move or sprint and adds 2 terrible dice to Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls. They lose the effects of a shield if wearing one and grant combat advantage to attackers.

##### Slowed
A slowed creature's move and sprint speeds are reduced by 1. Each level of slow reduces the value by 1, to a minimum of 1.

##### Stagger
A staggered creature is unable to take reactions until the start of their next turn.

##### Stunned
A stunned creature cannot move or take actions, and automatically failure Strength and Dexterity saving throws. Attackers gain combat advantage against this target.


##### Weaken
When a weakened creature hits with any attack or maneuver, all wounds are replaced with wound dice.

## Terms

##### Finesse
This weapon can use either Strength or Dexterity for attack rolls.

##### Loading
This weapon can only be used to attack once per round.

##### Range
This weapon can attack at range. Range is followed by two numbers, the near and far range. Attacks made inside the near range attack as normal while attacks within the far range add 2 terrible dice to the attack roll.

##### Reach
This weapon can attack creatures 1 tile further and their zone of control extends an additional tile.

##### Resistance
You reduce the number of wounds dealt by the level of resistance. For example, _Fire Resistance 1_ reduces all wounds taken from fire damage by 1.

##### Thrown
This weapon can be thrown using the ranged weapon proficiency instead. You may use either Strength or Dexterity for the roll. Thorn is followed by two numbers, the near and far range. Attacks made inside the near range attack as normal while attacks made within the far range add 2 terrible dice to the attack roll.

##### Two-Handed
This weapon requires both hands to use.

##### Versatile
This weapon can be used with two hands, using your two-handed proficiency. When used this way roll additional wound dice equal to the Versatile level.

##### Vulnerable
You increase the number of wounds dealt by the level of vulnerability. For example, _Bludgeoning Vulnerability 1_ increases the wounds taken by bludgeoning attacks by 1. If the attack can do damage, but didn't (due to rolling wound dice) a Vulnerable creature still takes the extra damage.

# The Gameboard
</br>

Most GM's use a gameboard when your adventurers are exploring a dungeon or fighting monsters. It can be difficult for players to visualize combat and see what choices they have without one. This rule book assumes you play with a square or hex grid along with miniatures or tokens. If you don't use a grid or use _theatre of the mind_ for your combat your GM may need to adjust or homebrew some of the rules in this section.

### The Tile Grid

The game world uses a square or hex tile grid with each tile representing a 5x5 foot area. Each creature takes up a number of tiles based on their size, which in the case of your adventurers is a single tile. For simplicities sake when determining movement or ability ranges on a square grid we assume that distance is _non-Euclidean_. Basically all this means is travelling to a square diagonal to you costs the same amount of movement as moving to a square orthogonal to you. Hex grids do a much better job at handling movement in all directions, but it can be hard to find resources that support hex grids.

___
>##### Variant Rule - No Diagonal Movement
>
>Another way to deal with diagonal movement costs is to prevent diagonal movement entirely. This essentially means that travelling diagonally costs 2 tiles worth of movement. If you do use this variant rule, make sure you calculate ranged attacks using the same method, taking 2 'range' to target someone on a diagonal.

### Creatures

Each creature is represented by a miniature or token on the gameboard. Creatures come in all different shapes and sizes, with each size taking up more or less of the board.

| Size | Tile's Occupied |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Tiny  | 1/4th |
| Small  | 1 |
| Medium | 1 |
| Large | 2x2 |
| Huge | 3x3 |
| Gargantuan | 4x4+ |

#### Movement
All creatures move and sprint speeds are listed in tiles. Any time a creature takes the move or sprint actions they can move up to that many tiles. When moving you may move through allies, but not through hostile creatures. If your movement takes you out of a hostile creatures zone of control they may make an opportunity attack against you.


#### Flying
Creatures that are able to fly can use their movement to move vertically, following the same rules as normal movement. Unless the creature is able to hover, any effect that reduces their movement speed to 0, grapples, restrains, or knocks them prone causes them to fall from the air. Falling creatures fall 10 tiles per round, increasing the amount by 10 for each round they spend falling. On hitting the ground or a solid object after falling 5 or more tiles they take a wound and a wound die in bludgeoning damage for every 5 tiles they fell.

#### Prone and Crawling
A prone creature grants combat advantage to all melee attackers, with ranged attacks adding 2 bad dice to their roll instead. A creature that is prone can crawl, spending an extra tile of movement for every tile travelled. Unless the creature has a move speed of 0 they can stand up by spending half of their move speed, rounded down.

#### Zone of Control
A creatures zone of control is a representation of the area they threaten in combat. A creatures zone of control is determined by his weapons reach. For most weapons this covers the 5 adjacent tiles to the creature centered on the direction the creature is facing. If a creature is using a weapon with _Reach_ their zone of control is increased by the same amount. You may enter a creatures zone of control without penalty, but attempting to move out of a creatures zone of control allows them to make an opportunity attack against you. The 3 tiles behind a creature are not part of its zone of control and so do not provoke opportunity attacks.

___
>**Variant Rule - Ignore Creature Facing**
>Sometimes tracking the direction a creature is facing can be difficult or slow down the game. When using this variant rule a creatures zone of control covers all tiles adjacent to the creature. If you play with flanking rules you can consider a creature as flanked if it has two hostile creatures adjacent to it with at least 1 tile of space between them.


___
>**Variant Rule - Flanking**
>When a creature is attacked by a melee attack from an attacker that is not in its zone of control the attacker is considered to be flanking that creature. Any attacks made while flanking a creature add 1 critical to their roll.

___
>**Variant Rule - Ranged Attack Disadvantage**
>With this variant any creature that tries to make a ranged attack, maneuver, or spell attack while another creature is adjacent to them adds 1 terrible die to their roll.

### Hazards and Terrain
Creatures are not the only thing on the battle field. Depending on the location there could be a deep river that inhibits movement, a trap that fires poison darts, a pit of bubbling acid, or even plain old darkness. Regardless of the location these hazards have an effect on your adventurers, and the clever ones can use them to their advantage.

#### Difficult Terrain
Deep water, thick brush, or a rubble filled room could be considered difficult terrain. When moving over difficult terrain every tile of movement costs an extra tile. For example, to move through a deep river 2 tiles wide you need to spend 4 tiles of movement. Climbing a wall or rock face also takes an extra tile of movement, with a difficult to climb wall taking 3 tiles of movement for every 1 tile climbed.

#### Traps and Hazards
Dungeons may be filled with traps or other hazards. Traps may be hidden, triggered only by a careless step or trip of a wire. Other hazards are blatantly obvious, like a pool of lava or ominous pit. While the exact mechanics of a trap or hazard is left up to the GM, characters can attempt to search or spot traps around them. Characters that succeed on a perception or investigation challenge may spot a trap or understand how it's triggered.

Hazards, such as a pool of lava or acid, are more obvious. Creatures that enter those tiles take damage immediately, taking damage again at the start of their turn for as long as they are in the hazard. A creature doesn't need to willingly move into a hazard to be affected by it. Characters can shove or push other creatures, or cast spells that knock creatures back.

#### Darkness
Most creatures are unable to see in the dark and struggle to see creatures in dim light. When making an attack, maneuver, spell attack, or trying to detect a creature in darkness you add 2 terrible dice to your roll, or 1 bad die if they are in dim light. Most of the time if a creature has a free hand they can light a torch, covering a 3 tile area around the creature in bright light and a further 3 tiles in dim light.

#### Cover
Some terrain can be used as cover, protecting creatures from attacks. Anything that obscures the creature or is large enough to hide behind can be used as cover, such as a stone fence, pillar, tree, or overturned table. The benefit you gain depends on the size of the cover and how well it could reasonably defend you against attacks. A creature that is fully behind cover, for example being behind a wall, are untargetable by most attacks. When the target of an attack, maneuver, or spell attack that targets your defense you add dice based on the table below:

| Cover | Bonus |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Quarter  | +1 superior defense die |
| Half  | +2 superior defense dice |
| 3 Quarters | +3 superior defense dice |
| Full | untargetable |

#### Underwater Hazards
Some dungeons may be submerged, or your adventures may take you to the depths of the sea. Creatures that do not have a swim speed or some method of moving underwater treat all underwater tiles as difficult terrain. Similarly, creatures that cannot breath underwater can only hold their breath for a limited time. A creature can hold their breath for 1 minute, adding a minute for each point of Stamina while not in combat. The exertion of combat greatly limits the time you can hold your breath, with creatures able to hold it for 1 turn, adding a turn for each point of Stamina.

For every minute, or turn in combat, a creature goes beyond their limit they make an exhaustion check against 2 terrible dice and 1 bad die. On failure they gain a level of exhaustion.


### Attack Types
Maneuvers and spells come in all kinds of shapes and sizes. Some might target a single creature, while others target an area. Depending on the description these attacks use one of the following areas.

##### Area of Control
When used by a maneuver this attack hits all creatures inside your zone of control. If your zone of control is extended by a weapon with _Reach_ then this attack's area is also extended. Spells that target your area of control, unless otherwise specified, do not benefit from _Reach_.

##### Line
Line attacks hit all creatures in a line extending outward from the attacker. This line doesn't need to follow the grid exactly and can be any direction you wish. A good rule of thumb is if the line crosses more than 1/3rd of the creatures tile it effects that creature.

##### Area
Area attacks hit all creatures in a square or rectangular shape centered on a tile. The spell or attack determines the size of the area. For example, the spell _Fireball_ hits all creatures in a 5x5 tile area. Spells that effect all creatures in a radius use this type, creating a square centered on a point with the given radius.

##### Diamond
Diamond patterns are similar to area attacks, but rotated 45 degrees. Diamond patterns will usually have a size before them; for example, a 3 tile diamond would have a size of 3. To determine if a creature is inside a diamond pattern, first make a horizontal and vertical line of tiles based on the diamond's size and centered on the target of the attack. Then, draw a line connecting each of the ends of the lines; if a tile is entirely inside the line, they are hit by the attack.

##### Touch
Touch attacks require you to be adjacent to the target, or have their effects begin in an adjacent tile.

##### Cone
Cone attacks are given as a length and width. The cone starts centered along the width, only effecting the center tile. The cone expands as you go down the length of the attack, reaching its width at the end. If the cone covers at least 1/3rd of the creatures tile it effects that creature.

### Damage Types
Damage can come from a variety of sources, such as the swing of a sword, an explosion of magic, or a deadly trap. Regardless of how it's inflicted, damage always falls into one of 3 categories: physical damage, elemental damage, and ethereal damage.

##### Physical Damage
The majority of physical damage comes from weapons. From the stab of a spear, swing of a sword, or impact of a hammer, physical damage covers 3 types:

___
- **Bludgeoning:** Impact from a weapon or heavy object.
- **Slashing:** The cut of a blade or trap.
- **Piercing:** The stab of a spear or puncture from an arrow.

##### Elemental Damage
The burn of a fire, chill of an intense cold, or a strike of lightning all fall under elemental damage. Most spells that deal damage deal one of the following damage types:

___
- **Fire:** The burn of a fire or explosion.
- **Cold:** The chill of winter or a frigid blast of wind.
- **Lightning:** The shock of lightning
- **Thunder:** Loud sounds, shockwaves, or blasts of air.
- **Poison:** Deadly poisons, acids, and other diseases.
- **Force:** The raw magical force inflicted by some spells.

##### Ethereal Damage
Ethereal damage directly effects a creatures body and soul. Draining life, causing something to decay, destroying somethings form, or smiting a creature are all examples of Ethereal damage. Ethereal damage covers 3 types:

___
- **Death:** Draining life or unnatural decay.
- **Holy:** smiting a creature or attacking their spirit.
- **Psychic:** causing madness or deteriorating the mind.

## Magic Items


Magic items give a variety of effects and bonuses. Only some magic items require attunement, and each character can only attune with 3 magic items at a time. While you can carry multiple magic items of the same type, you can only get the benefit of one of them. For example, you cannot get the benefit of a _Cloak of Shadows_ as well as a _Cloak of Waterbreathing_.

### Attunement

Some powerful magic items require attunement to use. To attune to a magic item you must spend 10 minutes focusing on it, and can be done during a short or long rest without interrupting the rest. If you are already attuned to 3 magic items you must choose which item to lose attunement to when attuning to a new item.

### Magic Gear

Magic weapons and armor can come with bonus modifiers from +1 to +3. When making an attack roll with a magic weapon you add superior dice to the roll equal to its bonus modifier. For magic armor you add superior dice to your defense roll equal to its bonus modifier instead. Shields do not have bonus modifiers, but can have additional effects.

### Identifying Magic Items

Magic items can be identified by a successful lore challenge. Each character can only attempt a lore roll once, if you fail then you must either cast _Identify_ on the item or take it to someone who can appraise it.

You can still use magic items without identifying them, but its bonuses will be unknown to you. If the item requires attunement you only benefit from its bonus modifiers unless stated otherwise.

### Gaining Attributes through Items

Some magic items grant bonuses to your attributes. While there is no limit on how much this can increase an attribute, you cannot benefit from two items that give bonuses to the same attribute, instead taking only the larger one.

For example, using a _Cloak of Agility_ granting +1 Dexterity and a _Belt of Elvenkind_ granting +2 Dexterity will only give you +2 Dexterity. You still benefit from the remaining bonuses on those items.

## Races

### Elves

#### High Elf

Like most elves, high elves display an otherwordly grace in all that they do. Often living in ancient, timeless forests, humans see high elves as beautiful and elegant, if not slightly arrogant. High elves stand slightly taller than the average human, ranging from 5 and a half feet to nearly 7 feet. However they are more slender, weighing between 100 to 150 pounds. While their complexion matches humans, their hair encompasses a larger range, from silver-white to deep black. Like all elves they have long, pointed ears.

It is rumored that high elves are descended from the fae, a group of magical and supernatural beings of another realm, seeming to explain their natural affinity with magic. Because of this many of the more mundane or superstitious races are wary of high elves, believing them to be responsible for any malady affecting their small villages.

Unlike the timeless, magical forests of the high elves, the wood elves call the savage forests their home. Wood elves display grace and strength in equal measure, being capable hunters and defenders of their forests. Their complexion tends to take on darker tones compared to their high elf cousins, often taking on a copper hue. Their hair ranges from deep reds to brown and black, but is occasionally blond or silver. They are slightly smaller than high elves, ranging from 5 to 6 feet. While they are still slender compared to humans their life in the forest has hardened their bodies, weighing between 120 to 160 pounds.

Due to their fierce dedication to their homeland, wood elves tend to be mistrustful of others, at least until they determine if they are a threat. Because of this most wood elves tend to stay in their forests, but there are those whose wanderlust takes them to explore the world beyond.

Seekers of knowledge, the star elves are nomads by nature. Their long lives allow them to see the world from a different perspective compared to the short lived races who see the star elves as aloof and unempathetic. Star elves are naturally curious, and because of this are gifted conversationalists. They love telling tales just as much as they do hearing them.

They are among the tallest races, averaging 7 feet tall, and also the rarest. They have a blue complexion that tends to fade to a pale white, with purple colorations being rare. Their hair is almost always a silvery blue, with eyes a dark blue or purple. Like other elves they have a slender appearance, weighing between 120 to 180 pounds.

### Goblinoid

___
#### Half-Orc

While most orcs are filled with an all-consuming lust for battle, there are some born free from their curse. Those that are often seek out neighboring human or elven settlements, resulting in half-orcs. Half-orcs retain much of their parents strength and ferocity, free from bloodlust and tempered by their other half. Because of this half-orcs are widely loved among the fringe villages and settlements of the world.

Half orcs stand between 6 and 7 feet. They tend to have strong, wide jaws with small but noticeable tusks, making it impossible to hid their orcish heritage. Their skin tends to be tinted gray green, and with their towering build they weigh between 200 to 250 pounds. Even with human parents half orcs have short, pointed ears, although those with elven parents tend to be longer. While their hair shares the color of their parents, often times they end up with black hair.

- **Lifespan:** 100 years

___
#### Tlani

Often confused for goblins or imps, tlani live far from the rest of the civilized world, preferring to make their homes high in the mountains or deep under the ground. They are short in stature, rarely standing taller than 4 feet. Like elves they have a strange, unnatural beauty to them that contrasts with their more beastial features, having long pointed ears, cat-like eyes and pointed teeth. Their complexion ranges from dark greys and blues to black with a white or silver underbelly. Their hair tends to match the color of their skin, but rarely it can be blue, green, or purple. Tlani are light, weighing between 40 and 60 pounds, and maintain a youthful appearance well into their 150s.

Due to their small stature, beast-like appearance and affinity for darkness they are usually called night goblins by humans. Tlani are extremely practical, preferring a logical and efficient solution to their problems leading to others seeing them as cold and amoral.

- **Starting Wounds:** 2
- **Move/Sprint:** 4/3
- **Attribute Bonuses:** +1 Dexterity, +1 Intelligence, -1 Strength
- **Lifespan:** 180 years

##### Occult

You are always under the effects of the spell _Dark Sight_ and you gain 1 superior die when making stealth rolls in dim light or darkness.



### Humanoid

#### Fallen

Despite their resemblance, fallen are not demons as some humans claim. They are one of the oldest races to emerge, along with the tlani, but their kind has dwindled, now living among the other races with no home of their own. Often seen as outsiders, fallen have relied on their wit and cunning to persevere, relying on their charm to get out of difficult situations.

While at times they can be mistaken for humans, all fallen are born with horns. They are taller on average, standing between 6 to 7 feet tall for males, with females being slightly smaller. Fallen are deceptively strong, and make adept warriors with their keen eyesight and bestial claws. Despite their slim stature, they weigh between 180-250 pounds.

- **Attribute Bonuses:** +1 Charisma, +1 Strength, -1 Willpower

___
#### Human

Out of all the common races humans are by far the most numerous. While humans are short lived compared to most, they are tenacious and adaptable, which has allowed them to spread to all corners of the world. Due to this humans span a variety of cultures and morals, taking in customs and traditions from their neighbors and adapting others.

- **Starting Wounds:** 3
- **Move/Sprint:** 4/2
- **Attribute Bonuses:** +1 to Any
- **Lifespan:** 70 years

##### Adaptable

You choose 3 bonuses when creating your character instead of 2.

___
#### Sylvan

Also known as forestfolk, sylvan make their homes in the gentle forests, meadows, and hills of the world. Like the elves, Sylan have an affinity with nature, preferring to live in small, rural villages instead of big cities. Naturally cheerful, sylvan recover quickly, be it from a night of boisterous reveling or from the dangers of the forest.

Sylvan are short compared to most, standing 3 and a half to 4 feet tall. Sylvan range from slim, almost child like figures to broad, almost dwarf like bodies. Because of this their weight varies wildly, ranging anywhere from 40 to 100 pounds. While their hair follows the usual shades of red, black and blond, it's not uncommon for some families to have emerald green hair and eyes.

- **Starting Wounds:** 3
- **Move/Sprint:** 4/3
- **Attribute Bonuses:** +1 Intelligence, +1 Charisma, -1 Strength
- **Lifespan:** 120 years

##### Forestfolk

During a short or long rest you restore 1 extra wound and mana. This feature has no effect if you've taken fire damage since your last rest.

___
#### Half-Elf

Mistaken for an elf among humans, and a human among elves. Half elves often live in human settlements as many elves do not accept half elves as true elves. Their long lives make it difficult to bond with other humans who see half elves as nonchalant and distant. Regardless their elven grace and human tenacity make them excellent hunters, a welcome trait in many of the human settlements of the world.

Half elves are similar in height to humans, averaging between 5 and 6 feet. Like elves they have pointed ears, but aren't as slender, weighing between 150 and 200 pounds. Their hair and eyes usually take after their human parent, but occasionally they will have the silver hair or copper complexion of their elven side.

- **Attribute Bonuses:** +1 to Dexterity
- **Lifespan:** 200 years

##### Innate Reflexes

### Dwarf

___
#### Hill Dwarf

Making their homes above ground in the hills around mountains, hill dwarves are experts at harnessing the power of nature. Building complex contraptions, hill dwarves construct water and wind mills to power their forges. They are meticulous crafters and skilled tradesdwarves. It is not unheard of for hill dwarves to travel far from their homes to study the craftsmanship of other races. Because of this hill dwarves are welcoming of most races, only shunning those they believe lack artistic talent, such as goblins or orcs.

Hill dwarves are the shortest of the dwarves, being a few inches shorter than mountain dwarves. They make up for their height by being the heaviest, weighing between 200 and 300 pounds. While most hill dwarves have beards, many trim or even shave them completely if they become an impedance to their craft. They are usually fair skinned with hair to match, with blond, brown and red being most common.

___
#### Mountain Dwarf

Among all the dwarves, none are as stout or hearty as mountain dwarves. Carving grand kingdoms under the mountains, they spend most of their lives below ground. Mountain dwarves uphold their traditions with an almost zealous fervor, believing that their traditions are what make them dwarves rather than their birth. Because of this dwarves are often staunch followers of the law, putting their clan above themselves.

While dwarves are shorter than humans, standing 4 to 5 feet tall, they are just as heavy. They are naturally strong, able to endure long hours of work even into old age. Dwarves hold their beards and hair in high regard, keeping them well groomed and often braiding or weaving beads and fabric into their beards. Mountain dwarves commonly have black or brown hair, but rarely have red or even blond hair. Their eyes match the metals and gemstones they mine, commonly being silver or gold, but can be a deep blue, red, or green.

- **Move/Sprint:** 4/2
- **Attribute Bonuses:** +1 Strength, +1 Stamina, -1 Dexterity
- **Lifespan:** 250 years

##### Hardy

Your max wounds is increased by 1 and you recover 1 extra wound during a long rest.


### Lizardmen

___
#### Lizardfolk

Lizardfolk live in the deadlier swamps and jungles of the world, forming small clans and tribes for survival. Most lizardfolk are unable to grasp the morals and customs of traditional civilization, their harsh environment giving them a singular focus: to survive. Lizardfolk are well suited to this life as they make deadly warriors, just as dangerous unarmed as they are with a spear or axe. While lizardfolk aren't skilled artisans, they are resourceful, using the bones and hides of their prey to fashion weapons and armor.

Lizardfolk tower over others, with some standing 7 and a half feet tall. With their long tails and hulking bodies, lizardfolk weigh between 300 and 400 pounds. Depending on the tribe they come from their scales can take on a multitude of colors, with green, blue, and red being the most common. While lizardfolk are hairless, some tribes have bright feathers covering their heads, extending down their backs.

#### Drake

While lacking the strength of their lizardfolk cousins, drakes use their cunning to survive the deadly environments they call home. Drakes are canny crafters, creating simple yet ingenious creations to aid in their survival. Drakes are almost singularly focused on survival, because of this they rarely experience fear or courage. Drakes rarely leave their lands, but can occasionally seek out allies from other races. When they do they are often confused by their companions actions, seemingly unable to understand the morals and behavior of civilized races.

Drakes are smaller than lizardfolks, standing 5 and a half feet at most. Their bodies are lean, weighing between 150 and 200 pounds. Their large, dragon-like wings allow them to easily glide through the air. Drake scales share the green, blue and red coloring of their cousins, but rarely some drakes are born a metallic bronze color.

- **Starting Wounds:** 3
- **Move/Sprint:** 4/3
- **Attribute Bonus:** +1 Dexterity, +1 Willpower, -1 Charisma
