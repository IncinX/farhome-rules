## Preface

What once started as a series of homebrew rules has turned into a full fledged rule book. Inside this book is a set of rules that many of you will be familiar with. Anyone who's played a fantasy tabletop roleplaying game has probably rolled dice to hit a goblin, made an athletics check to kick down a door, or cast an iconic fireball into a crowd of monsters. The rules in this book describe an alternate way to play the same game we've been playing for ages, one that hopefully gives a simplified, more engaging experience that offers players more _freedom_ with their characters. And _fun_, because I wouldn't be writing this if I didn't have fun playing it.

There are a few things here you won't find elsewhere, however. There are **no classes** in Farhome. Instead you are given a blank slate. **Backgrounds** help define who your character was before becoming an adventurer, leaving how they grow and advance up to you. Combat has been streamlined with **action points**, giving you more options in playing your turn. Dice rolls are always **contested** by either the GM or another player, keeping the game active and engaging. Dice rolls also use a **success/failure** system instead of adding numbers, with failure (and success!) always being a possibility.

While many things have been simplified, there's still loads of depth in these rules. They offer more ways to be creative with your characters and their actions, providing opportunities for teamwork while still giving each character their space to shine. Which is neat.

## Introduction

Farhome is a tabletop role playing system set in a fantasy world of magic, monsters, and adventures. You and a group of friends play as adventurers, exploring and interacting with a world created by another one of your friends, the Game Master. While the rules in the book give structure to how your adventurers interact with the world, largely the game is driven by you and your friends imaginations. 

You won't find any rules in this book about what you need to roll to climb up an ogre's back, but that doesn't mean your adventurer can't try. For every scenario that isn't handled by the book it's ultimately up to the Game Master to decide how it happens, or if it's possible. In this respect the players work together with the Game Master; the players describing the actions they want to take and the Game Master describing the outcome of those actions and how the world responds.

At the end of the day Farhome is a game about creativity, imagination, and having fun with your friends. It is a _collaborative_ experience, working with the Game Master to tell a story. With that being said you can expect to experience the following:
- battle goblins and orcs
- delve into dangerous dungeons
- find wondrous treasures, magical trinkets, or ancient weapons
- explore an ancient wode, a scorching desert, or the depths below the mountains
- meet noble kings and nefarious villains
- solve challenging puzzles and avoid deadly traps
- come to an untimely death
- roll a lot of dice along the way

## How to Play

Before you begin, you and your friends will need to determine who will be the Game Master. The Game Master (or GM) is in charge of the world, handling all the locations, monsters, and people in the world, while everyone else is in charge of an adventurer, or character. Usually the GM is played by the same person every game, but in some games it makes sense to rotate that responsibility. Regardless, the GM acts as the main story teller, or referee. If there's ever any confusion as to how something works, or if the players want to do something that this book doesn't cover the GM has the final say on what happens.

Farhome follows a narrative gameplay loop: the GM begins by describing the environment the adventurers are in, the players describe what they want their adventurers do, and finally the GM describes the results of those actions. This is the core of the game and is seen in every aspect of the game. For example the GM could be describing the dungeon your group of adventurers are exploring, giving the players a basic set of actions they could follow (the layout of the room, how many doors there are, if the adventurers see any creatures, and so on). The players then tell the GM what they want their characters to do, such as opening a door, searching for traps, or attacking a monster. The GM then describes the results of their actions: the door may be locked, or they find a poison dart trap, or surprise the monster. This often leads to another choice for the players, which starts the narrative loop all over again. This gameplay loop continues whether the players are exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters, or investigating for clues in a town.

Each time your group meets to play you can expect to spend 2-3 hours playing. During this time you can reasonably expect to: meet and interact with a notable non-player character (or NPC), explore a new location, fight dangerous monsters, and find something memorable. While some sessions you might never interact with an NPC, or encounter any monsters, it's these 4 experiences that build an adventure.

Adventures usually have a distinct beginning and end. As an example an adventure may require you to save a village from monsters. You will need to talk to the villagers and gather information about whats attacking them. The villagers may tell you the monsters live in the forest outside town, which you will need to explore. On finding the monsters lair you come up with a plan to defeat it, and after defeating it return to the village where they reward you with a magical sword. Your group may finish an adventure in a single session, or it might take many sessions, spanning many locations, people, and monsters.

When one adventure ends, another can begin. This string of quests and adventures is called a campaign. Campaigns can span months or years, with each adventure adding to one large story. Your character might die over the course of the campaign, either at the hand of a dangerous monster, villain, or any manner of way. You friends might search for a way to revive you, or you might create a new character. Over the course of the campaign your group may fail,or everyone may meet their demise. Even so, at the end of the day a successful campaign is one where everyone is able to have a good time, regardless of if your characters 'win' or 'lose'.

With that out of the way, how exactly do you start playing Farhome? Well, that part is fairly easy. The following pages describe everything from rolling dice, creating a character, and how combat works. With this you and your friends should be able to create a group of adventurers ready to explore a new and exciting world.

## GM Quick Start Guide

Creating a world of infinite possibilities can seem like a daunting task, and well, that's because it is. This book is woefully lax in guidelines on how to run the game, but I can at least get you started and out the door. Thankfully that won't take much, as while the world is infinite the space the characters are interacting with is tiny and constrained. For now anyways, more on that later.

To start, you'll need a minimum of 3 things: A town, a dungeon, and an obstacle for the players to overcome. Your players have to start somewhere in your world, and that place is usually a town. You don't need much for a town, a few names for the people living there, a tavern for players to meet them, and 1 or 2 places for your players to interact with, such as the mayors house or blacksmith.

Next is a dungeon. It doesn't have to be a literal dungeon, it could be an abandoned temple, a cave, or the lair of some ferocious beast. Whatever it is, it should be big enough for the players to explore, but not too big to get lost in. This usually means 2 or 3 rooms or 'encounters'. Your dungeon may have traps to prevent entry, or be filled with hostile creatures, or both! It needs something that adds challenge and danger for your players when they explore it. It also needs a reward for completing it. A magic item held by the strongest creature in the dungeon, or some treasure hidden behind the most dangerous traps.

Finally we need a reason for the players to explore the dungeon, the obstacle. This can be anything that motivates your players, for example the blacksmiths daughter was kidnapped and is being held there, it could contain a cure for a disease plaguing the town (and now players!), or it even could be a rumor of treasure. The obstacle serves to tie the town to the dungeon in a way that motivates the players. The players learn about the obstacle in the town, and head to the dungeon to overcome it.

With those 3 things you have your first adventure and are ready to run your first game. Making your second adventure will be easier than your first, you already have the town after all. As your game progresses, so does the world you created, adding other towns and villages as you need them. Maybe this land is ruled by a king, or some fiendish villain is plotting against the players behind the scenes.

As your players experience your world they'll eventually want to branch out. They may get access to spells making travel easier, want to seek out that dastardly villain, or just want to explore. Eventually you'll need a big world for them to explore, but all of that starts with a town, a dungeon, and an obstacle.

## Playing The Game

### Rolling Dice

Farhome uses a set of 6-sided dice to determine outcomes. There are 9 types of 6-sided dice, each with their own layout of successes or failures. With most dice rolls you roll a set of dice determined by your characters skills or abilities, adding challenge dice depending on the difficulty of the task. Rolling more successes than failures means your action succeeded. Sometimes your roll is contested by another characters roll. In these cases ties always go to the defender.

Some dice have special symbols on them for Critical Successes and Critical Failures. These count as 2 successes and 2 failures respectively as well as adding or removing a critical. Defense dice work similarly to the other dice, having defense symbols instead of successes. Finally wound dice are used to determine damage, healing, or in some cases chance.

#### Legend
- CS -- Critical Success
- S -- Success
- F -- Fail
- CF -- Critical Fail
- D -- Defend
- CD -- Critical Defend
- W -- Wound

#### Dice Values
| Die | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|:----:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--|
| Superior | CS | Sx2 | S | S | S | _ |
| Enhanced | CS | S | S | S | _ | _ |
| Normal | S | S | _ | _ | _ | _ |
| Bad | _ | _ | F | F | F | CF |
| Terrible | _ | F | F | F | Fx2 | CF |
| Defense | CD | D | D | D | _ | _ |
| Superior Defense | CD | CD | Dx2 | D | _ | _ |
| Wound | W | W | W | _ | _ | _ |
| Hero | S | S | Sx2 | Sx2 | CS | CS |

### Calculating a Roll
When making a roll you add up all your successes and critical successes, negating any failures and critical failures. Keep in mind that critical rolls count as both 2 successes and a critical. For example, 2 failures can negate the successes from a critical success, but it doesn't remove the critical part of that roll. Some abilities allow you to reroll dice or change the results of a die, which can change the outcome of your roll. Your roll is then contested by either the GM adding challenge dice to your roll or by another creatures roll. The roll is a success if you have more successes than your opponent, with ties favoring the defender if there is one, or the most neutral action

It's important to remember that rolls contested by a creature can change the outcome of your roll. The defenders criticals negate any criticals you have in your roll. For example, if you have more total successes than the opponents roll, but they rolled more criticals than you the action succeeds, but does not trigger any critical effects.

#### Determining What Dice to Roll
With the exception of defense rolls, your attributes and proficiencies determine what dice you roll. Defense rolls use defense and superior defense dice, while other rolls use superior, enhanced, normal, bad, and terrible dice. Wound dice are used to determine how much damage an action does, such as hitting a goblin with a sword or casting _Firebolt_.

Rolls that use your attributes will have an attribute and a proficiency score that determines what dice you use. For example, attacking with melee weapons uses your strength attribute and has a different proficiency score depending on if your using a one-handed or two-handed weapon. For these rolls you start with 5 normal dice. For every attribute point you have, replace a normal die with an enhanced die. Next, for every proficiency point you have, replace an enhanced die with a superior die. proficiency does not replace normal dice, you only benefit from proficiency up to your attribute score.

In the case where you have a negative number for your attribute score, replace a normal die with a Bad die. If your proficiency score is negative, replace an enhanced die with a normal die, or a bad die with a terrible die.

Through feats, spells, or items you may have an attribute score greater than 5. In this case for every point above 5 you have you add a normal die, replacing it with an enhanced die for every proficiency score above 5.

#### Defense Rolls
When making a defense roll you use defense and superior defense dice. The number and type of dice you roll is determined by what armor your wearing. You roll 2 defense dice when not wearing any armor or the armors value if you have armor equipped. Holding a shield adds either a defense or superior defense die, depending on the shield.

#### Attribute Saves
Attribute saves use the same rules as rolling a skill that uses an attribute, with one exception: negative attribute scores do not replace normal dice with bad dice. This means that the lowest you can roll is 5 normal dice. However, other effects and conditions, such as poison, still add dice. In almost every case when you roll an attribute save you are seen as the defender, with the roll siding in your favor on a tie.

In some cases your GM may ask you to roll a raw attribute. Rolling a raw attribute uses your attribute save proficiency and **is** effected by negative attribute scores.

#### Wound Dice
Many attacks and spells deal wounds and wound dice to their targets. When an attack says it deals wound dice you roll the dice, dealing damage based on how many wounds you rolled. For example, a spell that deals 1 wound and 2 wound dice in damage will 1 wound of damage, adding the result of the 2 wound dice to the target.

#### Hero Dice
Hero dice are special dice players can add to any roll. You gain a number of them at the start of your adventure and once spent are not replenished. You can add at most 1 hero die to any roll, except wound rolls. You may choose to add a hero dice after you have rolled. Hero dice are immune to any effects that would change the outcome of the roll, it cannot be hexed, rerolled, or negated.

Your GM may reward you with extra hero dice, but hero dice are usually only given at the start of each adventure.

#### Skill Challenge
Skill challenges are rarely made in contest, instead the GM will ask you to add dice depending on how challenging a task you are trying to accomplish. Each skill has its own proficiency and uses one of your attributes to determine dice. For example, an athletics check will use your strength score while an acrobatics check will use your dexterity score. Both athletics and acrobatics have their own proficiencies as well.

The outcome in these rolls isn't always a strict pass or fail, depending on the GM they may give a bonus if you roll a critical success or something bad may happen if you roll a critical fail. For skill challenges the character is always considered the 'attacker', with a tie or ending with 0 total successes counting as a fail.

#### Helping in Skill Challenges
In some cases you may want to help someone with an action, such as trying to push a boulder or search a room. When helping every participant rolls the same skill check contested by a single challenge roll. The highest roll among the participants is used, adding a success for every critical rolled by others.

##### Challenge Difficulty Dice
| Difficulty | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
|:----:|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Simple  | B | _ | _ | _ | _ | _ | _ |
| Easy  | B | B | _ | _ | _ | _ | _ |
| Average | B | B | T | _ | _ | _ | _ |
| Hard | B | B | T | T | _ | _ | _ |
| Difficult | B | B | B | T | T | T | _ |
| Impossible | B | B | T | T | T | T | T |

#### Rerolls
Either through expertise, feats, or other abilities you may reroll a number of dice in your roll. When rerolling, you may choose any dice to reroll, taking the new value instead, and you may not reroll the same die again. You may reroll any dice that are considered part of your roll, such as bonus dice from upcasting a spell, dice added from abilities or spells such as _Guidance_, and dice given by negative effects, such as poison. When making a skill challenge, all challenge dice are considered part of your roll and may be rerolled. 

Dice rolled in contest of your own roll, such as another creatures defend or saving throw, cannot be rerolled by you. Additionally, dice that have been replaced, such as dice that have been Hexed, cannot be rerolled.

#### Adding Dice
Some abilities allow you to add dice to certain rolls. Dice that are added as part of upcasting a spell, or from abilities that apply to your next roll must be added and rolled together. Hero dice, or abilities that allow you to add dice to any roll within a timeframe can be added after your roll, but before the outcome is determined.

For example, dice added from the spells _Guidance_ or _Weal_ add dice to your next roll that satisfies the condition. These dice must be added the next time you make that roll. 

On the other hand, dice added by the _Inspiring Words_ maneuver can be added to any roll made in the timeframe. If you wanted to add _Inspiring Words_ to your attack, you may wait to see the opponents defense before adding the superior die. Similarly, your opponent can wait to see your attack roll before deciding to add dice to their defense roll.

### Wounds

Wounds are used to determine how hard a character is to kill, the more wounds you have the more durable your character. Wounds are lost when you are hit by attacks, spells, or traps and are restored by taking rests or through certain spells.

Some abilities or effects inflict lesser or greater wounds. These do not deal damage, but do leave lasting effects. lesser wounds can be cured through magic, or after each long rest you choose a single lesser wound to remove. Greater wounds can be difficult to cure by magic. Each week that you have a greater wound you make a stamina save against 3 terrible dice, removing a single greater wound on success. Some greater wounds, such as losing an arm, cannot be healed naturally.

### Death Saves

When a character takes enough damage to drop them to 0 wounds or below they become unconscious and start making death saves. While unconscious you gain temporary wounds equal to half your total wounds rounded up. At the start of each turn you roll a wound die, losing 1 of your temporary wounds if the die rolls a wound. If you lose all of your temporary wounds your character dies.

Death saves aren't the only way you can lose temporary wounds, creatures can still make attacks against you and any melee attacks that hit you deal full damage regardless of the wound dice rolled. Likewise, allies can attempt to bring you back with healing spells, potions, or by stabilizing you. While in this state healing effects restore any lost temporary wounds first before restoring your wounds. If this brings you 1 wound or above you regain consciousness and no longer make death saves.

You can attempt to stabilize a character by making a medicine check. The check takes 10 AP and you must be beside the downed character to make it. Roll a medicine check, adding a terrible die for every temporary wound the character is missing. On success the character is stabilized, on failure the character restores a temporary wound for every critical success in your medicine check. A stabilized players's wounds are set to 1 and they no longer make death saving throws, gaining consciousness after 10 minutes.

### Action Points

Action points (AP) are used during combat. Each turn you refill your pool of action points which are spent taking actions, from moving, attacking, to casting spells. Aside from a few actions (listed in the Combat section) there is no limit on which actions you can take on your turn. Any unspent action points can be spent on reactions even when it's not your turn. Reactions are triggered by specific actions, for example opportunity attacks can only be made when a creature tries to leave your zone of control.

### Maneuvers

Maneuvers are special abilities that can be learned by your character. They can be learned by anyone, but most maneuvers require a weapon to be used. Using a maneuver is the same as taking any other action during your turn, however they have the following restrictions:

- You may only use one maneuver per turn, reaction maneuvers excluded.
- You cannot use the same maneuver on two consecutive turns in a row.

Additionally, most maneuvers have weapon or level requirements, or can only be used in specific situations, such as when an ally is attacked. The level requirement for maneuvers shows two levels, the first being the level you need to learn the maneuver and the second being the level it becomes **enhanced**. When your character reaches the maneuver's enhanced level it gains the effects described in the **enhanced** textblock.

### Healing Surge

Healing surges are used to heal wounds your character has suffered during a short or long rest. Your character starts with healing surges equal to your stamina score (minimum of 1) and gains an extra healing surge every 5 levels. When spending a healing surge you roll 3 wound dice, healing for the number of wounds rolled. You can spend any number of healing surges during a short or long rest. After each long rest you regain up to 3 of your spent healing surges.

### Combat Advantage

Some abilities may impose combat advantage against you or an enemy. Someone who grants combat advantage are easier to hit, giving anyone who makes an attack, maneuver, or spell attack against the creature an extra superior die to their roll.

### Attributes
Your characters aptitude is represented by 6 core attributes: strength, dexterity, stamina, intelligence, willpower, charisma. Each attribute governs a number of skills in addition to the following:

#### Strength
Each point of strength improves your melee attacks.

#### Dexterity
Each point of dexterity improves your ranged attacks and melee weapons with the _finesse_ property.

#### Stamina
Each point of stamina increases your max wounds by 1.

#### Intelligence
Each point of intelligence improves your arcane spellcasting rolls.

#### Willpower
Each point of willpower improves your curse spellcasting rolls.

#### Charisma
Each point of charisma improves your divine spellcasting rolls.

## Proficiency
Proficiency is a measure of how capable your character is at a given skill or task. Every skill, weapon type, spell school, tool, and attribute save have their own proficiency values which can be increased as your character grows. With the exception of spell proficiencies, there is no limit on how many skills you can be proficient in. You may only increase spell proficiencies if you have the appropriate background or feat.

Some feats or abilities grant you expertise in a specific skill. When rolling a skill you have expertise in you may reroll 3 dice, taking the new values.


### Skills

Skills represent how good your character is at completing different tasks and actions. Each skill has an associated attribute, and each skill has it's own proficiency modifier. There are no restrictions for which skills a player can add proficiency for.

### Tools

To use tools, you need to have at least 1 proficiency in the tool skill. Their full use is shown in the Appendix.

| Tool | Attribute |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Repair Kit | strength |
| Apothecary Set  | willpower |
| Enchanters Tools | intelligence |
| Scribing Tools | intelligence |

### Attribute Saves

Each core attribute has an associated attribute save. Attribute saves are a measure of how resistant your character is to specific spells or effects. For example, someone trying to shove you would make a roll against your strength save, or dodging a trap would roll against your dexterity save.

### Spell Schools

There are 3 schools of magic: arcane, curse, and divine. Each school uses its own proficiency and you must be trained in the spell school before you can add proficiency. Training can come from background or basic feats.

### Weapons

Weapons are split between simple and martial weapons. Simple weapons can be used by anyone and don't use their own proficiency modifier. Instead you use the relevant martial proficiency. When using a martial weapon that you don't have proficiency with you add 1 terrible die to the attack roll.

Weapon proficiencies are split between 4 categories: One Handed, Two Handed, Ranged, and Unarmed. By default melee weapons and unarmed use strength while Ranged weapons use dexterity, but this can changed based on the weapon. For example a weapon with the _finesse_ property can use dexterity, while weapons with _Thrown_ can use strength when used as a ranged weapon.

## Spells

Spells are split into 3 schools: arcane, curse, and divine. Each school handles a different type of spell and uses a different attribute for its spellcasting. arcane spells use the elements and raw power to defeat their foes, using intelligence for its attribute. curse spells disable and debuff their targets and uses willpower. divine spells center around healing and buffing targets and uses charisma.

To cast a spell you must have a codex containing the spell you want to cast, have the spell prepared, and have enough mana to cast the spell.

### Codexes

Very few creatures are able to innately cast magic. Almost everyone must prepare spells they've written into a spellbook, or codex. There is no limit on the school, level, or type of spell you can hold in your codex. New spells can be added to your codex by copying from spell scrolls or a codex. This process is destructive, and destroys the scroll or codex after a spell is copied.

##### Variant Rule - Spells from Codexes
In some games spells may be limited, or codecies a rare occurrence. With this variant when copying a spell from a codex, instead of destroying the codex you make an arcana check against 2 bad dice. On success codex is not destroyed. Regardless each spell can only be copied once.

### Mana

Casting spells of 1st level and above takes a toll on the caster. A character can only cast so many of these spells before needing to rest. Your mana is consumed each time you cast a spell, and you cannot cast a spell if you do not have the mana to cast it. Spells cost 1 mana per level to cast, increasing in cost at certain levels. You recover mana after taking a short or long rest.

| Spell Level | Mana |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1st-4th | Spell level |
| 5th  | 6 |
| 6th  | 8 |
| 7th  | 10 |
| 8th  | 13 |
| 9th  | 16 |
| 10th | 20 |

### Spell Power
Spell power determines how attuned your body is to spellcasting and how easy it is to increase your mana. When your character levels up you may choose to get mana based on your spell power. By default your spell power is equal to your characters level, and can be increased through leveling up or through feats.

### Preparing Spells

Before you can cast a spell from your codex you must prepare it. Every long rest you can prepare 5 spells, adding 3 for every point of intelligence you have. Having negative intelligence does not reduce the number of spells you can prepare. Once prepared spells are castable until the next day, even without your codex. The spells fade from your memory over the next long rest unless you prepare them again.

### Casting Spells

Each spell has either an AP cost or a time given as its casting time. There is no limit to the number of spells you can cast a turn as long as you have the AP to do so. Casting a spell that lists a time instead of AP can still be used in combat, but requires the casting time worth of full turns. For example casting a spell with a cast time of 1 minute requires 3 full turns to cast.

All spells, including cantrips, can be cast at a higher level if you have enough mana available. When casting at a higher level you spend Mana equal to the level your casting at, not the spells base level. Casting spells this way gives additional effects listed in the spell.

Depending on your character's level you will only be able to cast spells to a certain level. The table blow shows the maximum level your character can cast based on their level.

| Player Level | Spell Level | Player Level | Spell Level |
|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| 1st  | 1st | 15th | 6th |
| 3rd  | 2nd | 18th | 7th |
| 6th | 3rd | 21st | 8th |
| 9th | 4th | 24th | 9th |

##### Variant Rule - Attribute Based Spell Levels
Instead of your spell level being determined by your level, with this rule your spell level is determined by your attribute for a given spellcasting school. Your max spell level for arcane spells is based on your intelligence, curse spells are based on your willpower, and divine spells are based on your charisma. This means an exceptionally intelligent caster could cast high level spells at an early level- if they have the mana and spell prepared.

Your max spell level is determined on the chart below:

| Attribute Score | Spell Level |
|:----:|:----:|
| 0 or Less  | Cantrip |
| 1  | 1st |
| 2  | 2nd |
| 3  | 3rd-4th |
| 4  | 5th-6th |
| 5  | 7th-8th |
| 6+  | 9th-10th |

### Concentration

Some spells require concentration to maintain. You may only concentrate on a single spell at a time, casting a new spell with concentration will end the effects of the previous spell. When you take damage while concentrating on a spell you must pass a stamina save or the spell ends, adding 1 bad die, adding a bad die for every wound taken from the attack.

### Cantrips

Cantrips are spells that do not require mana to cast, but must still be prepared like the rest of your spells. For casting at a higher level, cantrips are considered level 0 spells and gain benefits when even 1 mana is used to cast it.

### Variant Rule - Misfires

While anyone can cast any spell they have the mana for, trying to cast a spell beyond your abilities can lead to a misfire. When casting a spell beyond your ability, either normally or through upcasting a different spell, you add 1 terrible die to the spellcasting roll for every rank beyond your ability. If you do not have any remaining successes before contesting with another roll the spell misfires. Roll on the misfire chart to determine the effect.

##### Ability Ranks
| Attribute Score | Spell Levels |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1  | 1st |
| 2  | 2nd |
| 3  | 3rd-4th |
| 4  | 5th-6th |
| 5  | 7th-8th |
| 6+  | 9th-10th |


##### Misfire Chart

Roll 2 bad dice, counting the successes.

| Roll | Misfire |
|:----:|:-------------|
| -4  | lesser wound: Mana leak. Every time you take at least 1 wound you lose 2 mana. Lasts until cured with _Treat Injury_ or you take a Long Rest. |
| -3 | Your spell backfires, roll a wound die for every remaining failure from your spellcasting roll, taking a wound for every wound rolled. |
| -2 | Wild magic fills the area around you, you and all creatures within 3 tiles add 1 terrible die to their next roll |
| -1 | Your flow of magic is interrupted, you add 1 terrible die to all spellcasting rolls for the next minute |
| 0 | Minor backlash. You take 1 wound die of Force damage |


## Creating a Character
Creating a character is simple, with only a few choices that you need to make early on. To start, choose a race for your character. The race determines your starting wounds, how far you can move or sprint, as well as your starting attribute bonuses. In addition, each race has a unique feat that all people of their race share. 

After picking a race, choose a background feat for your character. These are unique feats that can only be chosen during character creation, determining what kind of skills or abilities your character had before becoming an adventurer.

Next, assign your attribute scores. You start with a -1 to all attribute scores, adding any bonuses from your race. You get 9 free points you can arrange across your attributes how you want. At this stage characters can have a max attribute score of 3, with 5 being the maximum you can increase an attribute from leveling up.

You have 4 proficiency points to spend on your skills and saving throws. If you have a background or feat that gives you proficiency in a spell school you may increase your spellcasting proficiency.

Finally, choose 2 of the following bonuses.

#### Starting Bonuses
- Increase an attribute score by 1, with a max of 3
- Gain proficiency in a magic type
- Gain 4 proficiency points
- Learn 1 feat
- Learn a maneuver and gain 2 proficiency with a weapon type
- Increase your max wounds by 1
- Increase your spell power by 5 and gain 3 mana

##### Variant Rule - Rolling for Attributes
Instead of using the rules above for attributes, your group may decide to roll your scores. For each attribute roll 1 Superior, 3 Normal, and 1 terrible die, adding up the total successes. The minimum score for an attribute is -2, with any rolls below that counting as -2 for the roll.

##### Variant Rule - Group Rolls
Many people prefer the randomness given by rolling for attributes, but this can often lead to very powerful or weak characters across a group. A way to ensure every player is on the same level, each player takes turns rolling an attribute score. Once 6 scores have been rolled the players use those scores to create their characters. The players can place the scores in any attribute they want, but they must use the same 6 scores as every other player.

### Starting Equipment
Depending on your background you may start with additional gear. All players start with an adventuring kit containing a bedroll, 10 days of rations, a fire kit and 50ft of rope. In addition you start with 50 silver which you can spend on gear or upgrades. Any unspent silver becomes your characters starting money.

#### Currency
Currency in Farhome is divided into 3 types: the copper trite, silver cross, and platinum talent. An iron cross is worth 100 copper trites, and a platinum talent is worth 100 silver crosses.

| Cost | Upgrade |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 5sc  | any simple weapon |
| 10sc | Cantrip or Level 1 Spell |
| 10sc | Basic Healing Potion |
| 10sc | Buckler |
| 15sc | Padded or studded armor |
| 15sc | any martial weapon |
| 20sc | Upgrading armor to the next type |
| 30sc | A repair kit, apothecary set, enchanters tools, or scribing tools |

### Leveling Up

When you earn 1000 experience your character levels up. Each level you gain 1 proficiency point and choose one of the following bonuses:

- Gain 3 spell power and gain mana based on your spell power
- Gain 3 proficiency points
- Gain a feat
- Learn a maneuver
- Increase your max wounds by 1

**Mana**

When gaining mana, you apply the spell power gained from leveling up before increasing your mana based on the table below.

| Spell Power | Mana Gained |
|:----:|:----:|
| 1-8  | 3 |
| 9-18  | 4 |
| 19-28 | 5 |
| 29-40 | 7 |
| 41-55 | 9 |
| 56-70 | 12 |
| 70+ | 15 |


**Attribute Score increase**

Starting at level 3, every 3 levels you increase an attribute score by 1, up to a max of 5.

**Action Points**

Your max action points increases by 1 at levels 10 and 20.

**Max Wounds Increase**

Your max wounds increases by 1 at levels 7, 14, 21, and 28.

#### Earning Experience
Players earn experience after every encounter based on the difficulty of the encounter. Ideally characters should be leveling up once every 4-8 encounters. Experience is earned based on how difficult it is for the players to overcome the encounter, not by how much experience an individual monster gives.


##### Encounters
| Difficulty | Experience | CR level |
|:----:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Easy  | 100 | 75% Party Level |
| Average  | 100-250 | Party Level |
| Hard | 250-500 | 125% Party Level |

#### Variant - Milestones
An alternative to experience is milestones. Experience can in some cases be hard to keep consistent across adventures and can lead to some gamification problems with players. With milestones you gain a level after completing an adventure, or a portion of one.

## The Adventuring Day
As an adventurer you'll be spending just as much time travelling to and from the dungeon as you will delving its depths. Even the most battle hardened adventurers need to rest from time to time. Resting comes in two forms: short and long rests. Each day you can take at most two short rests and one long rest, taking any more than that has no effect.

### Travelling

A normal travelling day is 8 hours, with the distance travelled based on the terrain. You can push yourself to travel for longer at risk of gaining exhaustion. For every hour you spend travelling past 8 you make an exhaustion roll. Starting against 2 bad dice, you add 1 terrible die every time you make this roll. If you failure the exhaustion roll you gain 1 level of exhaustion and cannot travel further.

Travelling with a mount makes travel easier, removing most of the strain of travel. However, while travelling is easier for you most mounts won't spend more than 8 hours a day in travel. If your mount has the ability to fly you do not take any penalties to travel based on the terrain.

##### Travel Speed
|  | Type | Miles per Day |
|:----:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| _Terrain_  |  |  |
|  | Road | 16 |
|  | Plains, Forest | 12 |
|  | Mountain, Swamp | 8 |
| _Mounts_ | | |
|  | Horse, Mule | +2 |
|  | War Horse | +4 |
|  | Exotic | +2-8 |

### Short Rest

Short rests require an hour of uninterrupted rest to complete. During a short rest you may spend any number of healing surges to restore lost wounds. You regain mana equal to half your character's level, rounded up, with a minimum of 1. You only get the benefits of a short rest if you are able to complete it. Taking other actions, such as brewing a potion, breaks your rest.

### Long Rest

Long rests require 8 hours of rest with at most 2 hours of non-strenuous activity, such as keeping watch, preparing spells, or brewing potions. You automatically recover 1 wound and 3 healing surges over a long rest, and you may spend any number of healing surges to restore wounds. You regain mana equal to 3 + your character's level. If you go more than 24 hours without taking a long rest you must make an exhaustion roll against 2 bad dice and 1 terrible die. You make this check every 24 hours without a long rest.

When taking a long rest in the wilderness you must light a fire and make camp to gain the full benefits. To start a fire, make an average difficulty survival check. Depending on your location this roll may be easier or harder. On failure, instead of the normal benefits you regain 1 healing surge and restore mana equal to half your character's level. You may still spend any number of healing surges during this rest.

### Exhaustion
All adventurers need to rest from time to time, trying to do too much in a day can leave you exhausted. You can gain exhaustion from many situations, from travelling too long, not taking rests, spells, or abilities. At 6 levels of exhaustion your character drops dead.

##### Exhaustion Levels
| Level | All Proficiences | Max Wounds | Sprint
|:----:|:----:|:----:|:-------------|
| 1  | -1 | -1 | Yes |
| 2  | -1 | -2 | Yes |
| 3 | -2 | -3 | No |
| 4 | -2 | -4 | No |
| 5 | -3 | -5 | No |

## Combat

Combat is broken down into rounds where every combatant gets a turn. Turn order is handled by each characters initiative roll. Each round lasts ~20 seconds in in-game time.

#### Initiative

When combat starts every character and creature in combat rolls for initiative. By default, you roll 5 normal dice, improving 1 to an enhanced die for every point of dexterity you have, with negative dexterity converting die to bad die. You add a flat success/failure modifier depending on the circumstances. Surprised creatures start with 3 failures. These values can be changed by feats or skills, and other dice may be added.

Combatants take turns, starting with whoever rolled the highest and ending with whoever rolled the lowest initiative. After every combatant has had a turn the round ends and a new round begins, starting with the creature that had the highest initiative. This repeats until combat is over or one side has defeated all other combatants.

### On your turn

Each turn your action points are refilled. You can spend any amount of AP on your turn, and any unused AP can be used on reactions during the rest of the round. You gain no benefit for any unspent AP when your turn comes again.

#### Attack (5 AP)
Make a single weapon attack against a target creature. The actual damage, range, and effects of an attack depend on the weapon used in the attack. Unarmed attacks use strength and deal a wound die in damage.

To make an attack you must succeed an attack roll against the targets defense. If you have more successes than the targets defense you hit, with ties favoring the defender and counting as a miss.

##### Grapple
Instead of making an attack you can attempt to grapple a creature. To grapple, you make an athletics check, with the target choosing to make either a dexterity or strength save. On success the creature is grappled by you. While grappling a creature your move and sprint speed are reduced to 1 and cannot be increased, however the grappled creature is dragged with you. Anything that changes the AP cost of your attacks also effects grapples. Likewise you may attempt to grapple as many times as you want as long as you have AP and aren't currently grappling anyone.

You may end a grapple at any time. A grappled creature can attempt to free themselves on their turn by spending 5 AP. They make a strength save against your athletics check, freeing themselves on success.

#### Defend (5 AP)
Until your next turn you reroll 2 dice when making a defense roll, taking the new value. If you're holding a shield reroll 3 dice instead.

#### Move (3 AP, once per turn)
You may move up to your move speed in tiles. Some terrain, such as difficult terrain, requires 2 tiles of movement for every tile you traverse. Movement does not have be done all at once, you can split your movement as many times as you want. For example if you have a movement of 5 you may move 3 tiles, take another action, and then move the remaining 2 tiles.

#### Sprint (2 AP, can only be used after move, once per turn)
You may move up to your sprint speed, adding your dexterity score in tiles. Negative dexterity has no effect on your sprint speed. Moving while sprinting follows the same rules as the Move action.

#### Reaction Attack (2 AP)
When a creature tries to leave your zone of control (the 5 adjacent tiles in front of your character, making a U shape) you may make a reaction attack against them. You cannot use maneuvers (unless the maneuver says it can be used as a reaction) and the attack uses the default Attack rules.

#### Off-hand Attack (2 AP, can only be used after attack, once per turn)
When dual wielding, as long as you have made a single 'Attack' action, you may make an attack with your offhand weapon. This attack is identical to the _Attack_ action, except you do not get any bonus from proficiency.

#### Use (2 AP)
This covers a wide range of actions, covering things such as: using an item, drinking a potion, activating a magic item, or interacting with an object (eg: pulling a switch). Some magic items will give their own AP costs, using those instead. While there is no limit in how many times a turn you can take the Use action, some items may have restrictions. A creature can only benefit from a single potion each round.

##### Variant Rule: Using potions on others
You can use potions on downed creatures by spending 5 AP instead of 2. Normal potion rules still apply.

#### Spell (Varying AP)
There is no limit to the number of spells you can cast, as long as you have enough AP to cast them. Most spells will require you to make a Spellcasting roll against the targets defense or saving throw, with ties going in favor of the defender.


#### Maneuver (Varying AP)
Maneuvers have a variety of triggers, but unless otherwise stated must be used on your turn. Each turn you can use a single maneuver, after which that maneuver can't be used the next turn. You can still use a different maneuver the next turn.

#### Ready (Varying AP)
There are times you may want to hold your action, waiting for a specific circumstance before you take that action. At any point in your turn you may 'Ready' an action. You may only ready a single action and must pay the AP cost for the action immediately. For example, you could ready the _Attack_ action but not both the _Attack_ and _Move_ actions.

To ready an action you must first describe the circumstance that will trigger the action. This can be anything your character can perceive, such as "I want to attack if a goblin moves closer to me" or "I want to cast this spell when an enemy rounds that corner." You must also specify which action you want to take and must have enough AP remaining to take that action. If the circumstance did not happen before your next turn starts you lose the action.

Sometimes more than one readied action could be triggered by the same circumstance. In this case the actions occur in initiative order.

## The Gameboard

Most GM's use a gameboard when your adventurers are exploring a dungeon or fighting monsters. It can be difficult for players to visualize combat and see what choices they have without one. This rule book assumes you play with a square or hex grid along with miniatures or tokens. If you don't use a grid or use _theatre of the mind_ for your combat your GM may need to adjust or homebrew some of the rules in this section.

### The Tile Grid

The game world uses a sqaure or hex tile grid with each tile representing a 5x5 foot area. Each creature takes up a number of tiles based on their size, which in the case of your adventurers is a single tile. For simplicities sake when determining movement or ability ranges on a square grid we assume that distance is _non-euclidean_. Basically all this means is travelling to a square diagonal to you costs the same amount of movement as moving to a square orthogonal to you. Hex grids do a much better job at handling movement in all directions, but it can be hard to find resources that support hex grids.

##### Variant Rule - No Diagonal Movement

Another way to deal with diagonal movement costs is to prevent diagonal movement entirely. This essentially means that travelling diagonally costs 2 tiles worth of movement. If you do use this variant rule, make sure you calculate ranged attacks using the same method, taking 2 'range' to target someone on a diagonal.

### Creatures

Each creature is represented by a miniature or token on the gameboard. Creatures come in all different shapes and sizes, with each size taking up more or less of the board.

##### Creature Size
| Size | Tile's Occupied |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Tiny  | 1/4th |
| Small  | 1 |
| Medium | 1 |
| Large | 2x2 |
| Huge | 3x3 |
| Gargantuan | 4x4+ |

#### Movement
All creatures movement speeds are listed in tiles. Any time a creature takes the move or sprint actions they can move up to that many tiles. When moving you may move through allies, but cannot move through a hostile creatures tile. If your movement takes you out of hostile creatures zone of control they can make an opportunity attack against you as long as they have enough AP.

#### Flying
Creatures that are able to fly can use their movement to move vertically, following the same rules as normal movement. Unless the creature is able to hover, any effect that reduces their movement speed to 0, grapples, restrains, or knocks them prone causes them to fall from the air. Falling creatures fall 10 tiles per round, increasing the amount by 10 for each round they spend falling. On hitting the ground or a solid object after falling 5 or more tiles they take a wound and a wound die in bludgeoning damage for every 5 tiles they fell.

#### Prone and Crawling
A prone creature grants combat advantage to all melee attackers, with ranged attacks adding 2 bad dice to their roll instead. A creature that is prone can crawl, spending an extra tile of movement for every tile travelled. Unless the creature has a move speed of 0 they can stand up by spending half of their move speed, rounded down.

#### Zone of Control
A creatures zone of control is a representation of the area they threaten in combat. A creatures zone of control is determined by his weapons reach. For most weapons this covers the 5 adjacent tiles to the creature centered on the direction the creature is facing. If a creature is using a weapon with _Reach_ their zone of control is increased by the same amount, extending outward. You may enter a creatures zone of control without penalty, but attempting to move out of a creatures zone of control allows them to make an opportunity attack against you. The 3 tiles behind a creature are not part of its zone of control and so do not provoke opportunity attacks.

##### Variant Rule - Ignore Creature Facing
Sometimes tracking the direction a creature is facing can be difficult or slow down the game. When using this variant rule a creatures zone of control covers all tiles adjacent to the creature. If you play with flanking rules you can consider a creature as flanked if it has two hostile creatures adjacent to it with at least 1 tile of space between them.

##### Variant Rule - Flanking
When a creature is attacked by a melee attack from an attacker that is not in its zone of control the attacker is considered to be flanking that creature. Any attacks made while flanking a creature add 1 critical to their roll.

##### Variant Rule - Ranged Attack Disadvantage
With this variant any creature that tries to make a ranged attack, maneuver, or spell attack while another creature is adjacent to them adds 1 terrible die to their roll.

### Hazards and Terrain
Creatures are not the only thing on the battle field. Depending on the location there could be a deep river that inhibits movement, a trap that fires poison darts, a pit of bubbling acid, or even plain old darkness. Regardless of the location these environments have an effect on your adventurers, and the clever ones can use it to their advantage.

#### Difficult Terrain
Deep water, thick brush, or a rubble filled room could be considered difficult terrain. When moving over difficult terrain every tile of movement costs an extra tile. For example, to move through a deep river 2 tiles wide you need to spend 4 tiles of movement. Climbing a wall or rock face also takes an extra tile of movement, with a difficult to climb wall taking 3 tiles for every 1 tile climbed.

#### Traps and Hazards
Dungeons may be filled with traps or other hazards. Traps may be hidden, triggered only by a careless step or trip of a wire. Other hazards are blatantly obvious, like a pool of lava or omnious pit. While the exact mechanics of a trap or hazard is left up to the GM, characters can attempt to search or spot traps around them. Characters that succeed on a perception or investigation challenge may spot a trap or understand how it's triggered.

Hazards, such as a pool of lava or acid, are more obvious. Creatures that enter those tiles take damage immediately, taking damage again at the start of their turn for as long as they are in the hazard. A creature doesn't need to willingly move into a hazard to be effected by it. Characters can shove or push other creatures, or cast spells that knock creatures back.

#### Darkness
Most creatures are unable to see in the dark and struggle to see creatures in dim light. When making an attack, maneuver, spell attack, or trying to detect a creature in darkness you add 2 terrible dice to your roll, or 1 bad die if they are in dim light instead. Most of the time if a creature has a free hand they can light a torch, covering a 3 tile area around the creature in bright light and a further 3 tiles in dim light.

#### Cover
Some terrain can be used as cover, protecting creatures from attacks. Anything that obscures the creature or is large enough to hide behind can be used as cover, such as a stone fence, pillar, tree, or overturned table. The benefit you gain depends on the size of the cover and how well it could reasonably defend you against attacks. A creature that is fully behind cover, for example being behind a wall, are untargetable by most attacks. When the target of an attack, maneuver, or spell attack that targets your defense you add dice based on the table below:

| Cover | Bonus |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Quarter  | +1 superior defense die |
| Half  | +2 superior defense dice |
| 3 Quarters | +3 superior defense dice |
| Full | untargetable |

### Attack Types
Maneuvers and spells come in all kinds of shapes and sizes. Some might target a single creature, with others targeting an area. Depending on the description these attacks use one of the following areas.

##### Area of Control
When used by a maneuver this attack hits all creatures inside your zone of control. If your zone of control is extended by a weapon with _Reach_ then this attack's area is also extended. Spells that target your area of control, unless otherwise specified, do not benefit from _Reach_.

##### Line
Line attacks hit all creatures in a line extending outward from the attacker. This line doesn't need to follow the grid exactly and can be any direction you wish. A good rule of thumb is if the line crosses more than 1/3rd of the creatures tile it effects that creature.

##### Area
Area attacks hit all creatures in a square or rectangular shape centered on a tile. The spell or attack determines the size of the area. For example, the spell _Fireball_ hits all creatures in a 5x5 tile area. Spells that effect all creatures in a radius use this type, creating a square centered on a point with the given radius.

#### Diamond
Diamond patterns are similar to area attacks, but rotated 45 degrees. Diamond patterns will usually have a size before them, for example a 3 tile diamond would have a size of 3. To determine if a creature is inside a diamond pattern, first make a horizontal and vertical line of tiles based on the dimaonds size, centered on the target of the attack. Then draw a line connecting each of the ends of the lines, if a tile is entirely inside the line they are hit by the attack.

#### Touch
Some attacks have a range of 'touch'. Touch attacks require you to be adjacent to the target, or have their effects begin in an adjacent tile.

#### Cone
Cone attacks are given as a length and width. The cone starts centered along the width, only effecting the center tile. The cone expands as you go down the length of the attack, reaching its width at the end. If the cone covers at least 1/3rd of the creatures tile it effects that creature.

## Conditions
There are a number of conditions creatures can be subjected to, each with different effects. Some conditions have a level associated with them to determine the potency of that condition. For example, poison normally adds a bad die to your attack rolls and saving throws, where poison 2 and poison 3 adds 2 and 3 bad dice respectively.

##### Blind
A blinded creature loses the ability to see. While blind they add 2 terrible die to all attack, spellcasting, and dexterity saving throws. They cannot make reactions.

##### Dazed
A dazed creature cannot take the Sprint or Reaction actions and grant combat advantage to attackers.

##### Fear
a feared creature cannot willingly move closer to the source of the fear. While the source is within line of sight, they add 1 bad die to any rolls made.

##### Grapple
A grappled creature cannot move and adds 2 bad die to dexterity saving throws, and grants combat advantage to attackers, except for the grappler.

##### Hex
When making any roll, a Hexed creature replaces a critical with a single success for every level of Hex on the creature. For example, a creature with Hex 2 will replace the first 2 crits they roll with a single success each.

##### Incapacitated
An incapacitated creature takes no actions and automatically fails strength and dexterity saving throws.

##### Paralyzed
A paralyzed creature automatically failure dexterity saving throws. When taking any Action they must first roll a wound die. If the result is a wound they do not take the action and lose the AP spent.

##### Poison
A poisoned creature adds a bad die to all attacks, saving throws, and ability checks, adding a bad die for every level of poison. Only the highest level poison takes effect. For example someone who has poison and poison 2 only adds 2 bad dice instead of 3.

##### Prone
a prone creature grants combat advantage to any melee attacker. Ranged attacks against this creature add 2 bad dice to their roll.

##### Restrained
A restrained creature cannot move and adds 2 bad die to dexterity saving throws and attack rolls. They lose the effects of a shield if wearing one and grant combat advantage to attackers.

##### Slowed
A slowed creature's Move and Sprint speeds are reduced by 1. Each level of slow reduces the value by 1, to a minimum of 1.

##### Stagger
A staggered creature is unable to take reactions until the start of their next turn.

##### Stunned
A stunned creature cannot move or take actions, and automatically failure strength and dexterity saving throws. Attackers gain combat advantage against this target.

##### Weaken
When a weakened creature hits with any attack or maneuver, all guaranteed wounds are replaced with wound dice, dealing a wound only if the die rolls a wound.

## Magic Items

Magic items give a variety of effects and bonuses. Only some magic items require attunement, and each character can only attune with 3 magic items at a time. While you can carry multiple magic items of the same type, you can only get the benefit of one of them. For example, you cannot get the benefit of a _Cloak of Shadows_ as well as a _Cloak of Waterbreathing_.

### Attunement

Some powerful magic items require attunement to use. To attune to a magic item you must spend 10 minutes focusing on it, and can be done during a short or long rest without interrupting the rest. If you are already attuned to 3 magic items you must choose which item to lose attunement to when attuning to a new item.

### Magic Weapons

Magic weapons can come with bonus modifiers from +1 to +3. When making attack rolls with these weapons you add a superior die for every bonus modifier.

### Magic Armor

Magic armors can come with bonus modifiers from +1 to +3. When making defense rolls with this armor you add a superior defense die for every bonus modifier.

Shields cannot have bonus modifiers, but can have additional effects.

### Identifying Magic Items

Magic items can be identified by a successful lore challenge. Each character can only attempt a lore roll once, if you failure then you must either cast _Identify_ on the item or take it to someone who can appraise it.

You can still use magic items without identifying them, but its bonuses will be unknown to you. If the item requires attunement you only benefit from its bonus modifiers unless stated otherwise.

### Gaining Attributes through Items

Some magic items grant bonuses to your attributes. While there is no limit on how much this can increase an attribute, you cannot benefit from two items that give bonuses to the same attribute, instead taking only the larger one.

For example, using a _Cloak of Agility_ granting +1 dexterity and a _Belt of Elvenkind_ granting +2 dexterity will only give you +2 to your dexterity attribute. You still benefit from the remaining bonuses on those items.

## Terms

##### Finesse
This weapon can use either strength or dexterity for attack rolls.

##### Loading
This weapon can only be used to attack once per turn.

##### Range
This weapon can attack at range. Attacks further than the close range add 2 terrible dice to the roll, and cannot attack farther than the far range.

##### Reach
This weapon can make attacks 1 tile further, and their zone of control extends an additional tile.

##### Resistance
You reduce the number of wounds dealt by the level of resistance. For example, _Fire Resistance 1_ reduces all wounds taken from fire damage by 1.

##### Thrown
This weapon can be thrown using the ranged weapon proficiency instead. You may use either strength or dexterity for the roll. Attacks further than the close range add 2 terrible dice to the roll, and cannot attack farther than the far range.

##### Two-Handed
This weapon requires both hands to use.

##### Versatile
This weapon can be used with two hands, using the two-handed proficiency. When used this way roll additional wound dice equal to the Versatile level.

##### Vulnerable
You increase the number of wounds dealt by the level of vulnerability. For example, _Bludgeoning Vulnerability 1_ increases the wounds taken by bludgeoning attacks by 1. If the attack can do damage, but didn't (due to rolling wound dice) a Vulnerable creature still takes the extra damage.

#### Scribing Tools
A set of tools for writing spell scrolls and inscribing runes. During a long rest you may attempt to inscribe a single rune or spell scroll. Spell scrolls are written in a way such that anyone is able to learn it and add it to their codex. Runes are consumables that give a variety of one time effects, from enhancing one of your spells to creating a magical trap. Creating scrolls and runes requires mana and uses a mix of gemstones and enchanting supplies which can be found in most cities and towns.

#### Inscribing Spell Scrolls
You can create a spell scroll for any spell in your codex that you are able to cast. Creating a spell scroll of 3rd level or lower can be done during a long rest, with spells of 4th level and higher taking 1 day of work for each level above 3rd. You must have mana available which is consumed in creating the scroll.

When copying spells from a codex you can instead use your scribing tools to create a spell scroll. Doing so costs a single enchanting supply regardless of spell level, ignoring all other costs for creating spell scrolls. For each spell you want to remove from the codex and turn into a scroll you make a inscription roll against that spell levels difficulty. On success you create a spell scroll for that spell, destroying the codex on failure.
