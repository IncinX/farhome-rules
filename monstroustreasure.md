#### Net
A net made of rope, leather, or twined fibers used to catch a medium or smaller creature. Used in place of the attack action, make a ranged attack using Strength or Dexterity against a creature within 2 tiles. The creature makes a Dexterity save against the attack, being grappled on hit.

Once grappled, the creature can spend 5 AP on their turn making a Strength save against 5 Enhanced dice, freeing themselves and destroying the net on success. Another creature can free the grappled creature by spending 1 turn cutting through the net with an edged weapon, or 1 minute untangling the net.

The net must be properly bundled before being thrown again, reqeuiring 5 minutes of work.

**Barbed Net:** Adding barbs to the next causes it to deal 1 wound die in piercing damage on hit and every time the grappled creature attempts a Strength save to free themselves from the net.

**Banded Net:** A net reinforced with metal. Adds 1 Bad die to your attack rolls with the net. The grappled creature makes a Strength save against 5 Superior dice instead of Enhanced, and attempting to cut the net requires a successful attack roll against 3 Superior Defense dice.

**Enchanted Net:** A net made with enchanted rope that seeks out its target. You may target creatures up to 5 tiles away and add 1 Superior die to your attack roll.

#### Caltrops
A sack of caltrops, enough to cover 2 tiles. By spending 5 AP you spread caltrops in 2 adjacent tiles. The Caltrops count as difficult terrain and any creature that falls into the caltrops, either by falling or being knocked prone, takes 1 wound in piercing damage.

#### Whistle
A simple whistle made out of wood. You may spend 2 AP to blow the whistle which is audible up to 60 tiles away.

#### Smoke Pellet
Small beads that when thrown create an area of obscuring smoke. You may spend 2 AP to throw the pellet up to 5 tiles, exploding in a cloud of smoke covering a 3x3 tile area centered on the impact.

**Black Powder Pellet:** Creates a cloud of flammable black powder when thrown. Any fire in the 3x3 tile area, such as a torch or the flaming projectile of a spell like _Firebolt_ causes it to ignite. All creatures make a Dexterity save against 4 Enhanced dice, taking a wound and wound die in fire damage on fail.

#### Grapple Hook
A metal hook attached to 50 ft of rope. Used in place of an attack action, make a ranged attack using Strength or Dexterity targeting a point within 10 tiles.

#### Rope
A bundle of rope 50 ft long. A creature bound by the rope can attempt to break free once every hour by making a Strength save against 5 Enhanced dice. On success the rope breaks.

**Banded Rope:** Rope reinforced with metal. Attempting to break the rope uses 5 Superior dice instead of Enhanced dice.

**Chain:** A metal chain 10 ft long. Attempting to break the chain uses 7 Superior dice for the Strength save.

#### Antidote

#### Prayer Chalk
Chalk made from bones purified by a priest. You may spend 1 minute per tile etching holy wards and inscriptions. For the next day undead treat the inscriptions as difficult terrain and any undead that pass over the inscriptions add 1 bad die to all attacks and saving throws until the end of their next turn.

Each piece of chalk can cover 10 tiles.

#### Snare
Contains everything needed to make a simple snare trap. The snare takes 5 minutes to set up and covers a single tile, making a raw Dexterity or Intelligence roll to determine how well it's hidden. A creature attempting to see the trap makes a Survival or Perception check against your roll, seeing the trap on success.

When triggered by a large or smaller creature they are grappled and knocked prone. The creature or an ally can spend 5 AP to cut the snare, freeing them and destroying the trap.

#### Bear Trap
A metal floor trap used to immoblize large creatures. The trap takes 5 minutes to set up and covers a single tile, making a raw Dexterity or Intelligence roll to determine how well it's hidden. A creature attempting to see the trap makes a Survival or Perception check against your roll, seeing the trap on success.

When a large or medium creature steps on the trap they make a Defense roll against 4 Enhanced dice. On hit they are grappled and take a wound and a wound die in piercing damage. They or another creature can spend 5 AP to make a Strength save against 4 Enhanced dice, freeing themselves on success.

#### Black Resin
