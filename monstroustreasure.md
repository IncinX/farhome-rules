## Bestary of Monsters

Contains a bunch of ready to use monsters, etc.

### Monster Level
Each monster is given a Monster Level or Challenge, denoted with a C, that gives a rough estimate of the danger a monster poses to the party. Monster level is comparable to a characters level. For example, a monster with a monster level of 5 should be an average challenge to a 5th level character. When building encounters a good estimate of difficulty is comparing the sum level of all monsters and the sum level of the party.

### Building Encounters
While monster level givs a good estimate of an encounters difficulty, there are other factors to keep in mind. Preparation, party composition, and action economy can turn a deadly encounter to an easy one, or an easy encounter into a grueling bloodbath. An ambush could down one or more party members, putting the party on the back foot for the encounter. A ghost (C4) is much more deadly to a party that primarily uses physical damage than a party with access to magic. A swarm of monsters, while not individually dangerous, can overwhelm parties with the sheer number of attacks they make each round.

As an example lets create an encounter for a party of 4, 2nd level characters. The party is exploring a goblin cave and stumble across a goblin patrol. We want this encounter to be an average difficulty for the party, so we are aiming to have a total monster level of 8. We could use 8 goblin fighters (C1) or 4 goblin fighters and 8 goblins (C1/2). If we want to turn this encounter into a deadly encounter we could add a goblin shaman (C3) to increase the monster level or change one of the other factors that influences difficulty. The goblins could know the party is coming and lay an ambush, attacking the most vulnerable party members first.

#### Encounter Composition
It's always a good idea to bring creatures with a variety of attacks to challenge your players. Often characters will excel against certain types of enemies. For example, a heavily armored character wearing full plate and holding a shield may seem impervious to an army of goblins. Likewise, a wizard in robes would be quick work for even a handful of goblins. A good encounter is one that challenges each player, while also allowing players to shine.

Lets take our goblin example. 8 goblins may not be threatening to a hearty group of adventurers decked out in heavy armor, even when ambushed. Those same goblins, however, against a group of thieves or wizards are much more likely to down or kill a character. This is due to the fact that goblins almost entirely challenge the party through _Defense_ rolls. By changing which rolls the party needs to defend against we can change the _challenge_ of the encounter without changing its _difficulty_.

In our example if we swap 3-4 goblins with 1-2 goblin shaman the difficulty remains the same, only we've now changed how we challenge the players. The shaman's _Static Shock_ is especially dangerous to heavily armored characters as it requires a Dexterity save, while _Poison Trap_ can reduce the effectiveness of any character with low Stamina.

Best of all, good encounter design encourages parties to work together and allows players a way to shine in combat. A clever party may send their dexterous rogue to deal with the shaman while the sturdy warrior engages the goblin pack. While this book tries to give monsters a variety of tools to challenge your players, sometimes you'll need to tweak things to your table's needs. Your shaman may know _Hex_ instead of _Poison Trap_, or your goblin fighter may use the _Cleave_ maneuver.

### Harvesting Monsters

### Creating your own Monsters

### Reading a Monster's Statblock
The monsters in this book are arranged into condensed stat sheets. These stat sheets, or statblocks, have all the information you need to run the monster in combat, but requires some explanation. Lets take a look at the first monster in this book: the wolf.

#### Wolf
 | | | | |
 |:---|---:|:---|---:|

 | **Wounds:** | 2 | **Challenge:** | 1 |
 | **Move/Sprint:** | 5/5 | **Size:** | Medium |

|STR|DEX|STA|INT|WIL|CHA|

|1/1|2/2|1/1|-2/0|0/0|0/0|

___
***Pack-Tactics.*** This creature has Combat Advantage when attacking a creature that is adjacent to an ally.

**Actions**

***Bite.*** *Melee Attack:* 5 AP, 2/0/3/0/0 - On hit deals 1/1 in piercing damage.

***Leap.*** *Melee Attack, Maneuver:* 7 AP, Range 2, 2/0/4/0/0 - The wolf leaps up to 2 tiles, ending in a tile adjacent to the target creature. The creature makes a Defense or Dexterity save, taking 1/1 in piercing damage on fail, being knocked prone on a critical.
___

As you can see there is quite a bit going on here. The statblock is broken down into 4 parts. The first are the monsters general stats. Here you will find:
- **Defense:** The dice to roll when making a defense save, the first number being Superior Defense and the second being Defense dice.
- **Wounds:** The max wounds of the monster.
- **Move/Sprint:** The monster's move and sprint speed, in tiles.
- **AP:** How many action points this monster has per turn.
- **Challenge:** A rough estimate of this monster's challenge.
- **Size:** How large the monster is, determining how many tiles this monster occupies.

Next is the monster's attribute array. The array is arranged so that each attribute has two numbers, the first being the attribute score followed by the proficiency score for that attributes saving throw. The next section contains the monsters feats and abilities. These describe any special bonuses or abilities the monster has. In the wolf's case it has _Pack-Tactics_, which gives it Combat Advantage when making attacks next to an ally. This section will also note any resistances, vulnerabilities, or spells this monster can cast.

The final section contains all the actions a monster can take. Each action follows the same structure. The first part describes what the action is, such as if it's a melee or ranged attack, reaction, maneuver, or a special action that doesn't fall into any category. Next is the AP cost for the action, any other modifiers, such as Range or Reach, and the dice array for the actions roll. The dice array lists how many of each dice to roll, from left to right, Superior, Enhanced, Normal, Bad, Terrible. The final section contains a description of the action along with any effects or damage the action inflicts. If the action deals damage the damage will be listed in a wound array, listed as wounds followed by wound dice.

- Chaos - Chaotic Evil

The blades were divided between the various races to protect them, ensure their survival, and prevent any one race from becoming too powerful.

### Crafting Magic Items

With the correct ingredients and skill, an enchanter can create magical items beyond normal enchantments. These items become permanent magic items. The creation is prone to errors, and even the most seasoned enchanter can never truly be sure of their creation.

Creating magic items takes time and a dedicated space to craft in. They require parts from a magical creature, rare materials, and costly enchanting supplies. Crafting items can end up being a quest in itself.

### Dungeons and Encounters

Now that we have a bunch of monsters and items we need to use them. The following are quick dungeons and encounters you can use in your games, or as inspiration.

### Forest Temple

Deep in the forest is a ruined temple, once dedicated to a god of the forest. Now the temple is being used as a home for monsters. This dungeon gives examples for using goblins, kobolds, or undead, but this can be adapted to almost any monster. The monsters in this temple are organized by a cunning leader, which means they will be on the lookout for any adventurers that may come to clear them out.

### Hooks

There's plenty of ways to integrate this into your game. The monsters could be harassing a small town or village the players travel through. A Church dedicated to the god may hire the players to retrieve a long lost item from the temple. Or the players could just stumble upon one of the monsters patrols while travelling through the forest.

### Difficulty

This dungeon is designed for a party of 4 between levels 1-4.

#### Temple Exterior

A small clearing around a stairway built into the side of a hill. The monsters have cleared some of the undergrowth around the entrance where a handful of guards stand watch.

##### Monsters
| Type | Monsters |
|:---:|:------|
| Goblins | 1-2 Goblins, 1 Goblin Fighter |
| Kobolds | 2 Kobolds |
| Undead | 1 Ghost |

A handful of monsters stand guard outside the temple. These guards have been tasked with watching for any threats and alerting the temple if any are spotted. However the remoteness of the temple has left them complacent and easily bored. Careful players will spot the guards before being spotted themselves.

The forest surrounding the temple is dense, providing ample cover. A player can sneak up on the guards with a successful Stealth check against an easy challenge. If the players are spotted, or if the guards are attacked they will try to alert the temple by sending one of the guards, or themselves, inside to warn the others.

After defeating or otherwise bypassing the guards the players will be able to descend the stairs into the underground temple.

#### Temple Entrance

The stairs descend into a dimly lit room. On one wall is a partially destroyed mural of the god of the forest. The doorway across the room has collapsed with age, leaving only one way forward through the temple.

There are no monsters in this room, however a perceptive player may hear the sounds of monsters deeper in the temple. The mural depicts an elven druid using a wand to tend to the forest before heading back to an altar. A player can make a Religion check against an average challenge. On success they decipher the mural and learn of a secret cache hidden behind an altar deeper in the temple.

There is a single doorway leading deeper into the temple, protected by a snare trap. A player can spot the trap by making a successful Perception check against an easy challenge. Once spotted the trap can be easily disarmed or avoided. If a player steps on the tile infront of the door the trap is triggered. The player makes a Dexterity save against a hard challenge, taking 1 wound in piercing damage and gaining Slow 1 for 1 minute on fail. Once triggered the trap cannot be triggered again.

#### Temple Hall

A large room with a water fountain against the left wall. The fountain has long since gone dry, with moss and vines growing from it instead. The room is being used as a nest for the monsters. The only exit is a door leading to a hallway on the far wall.

##### Monsters
| Type | Monsters |
|:---:|:------|
| Goblins | 3-6 Goblins, 1-4 Goblin Fighters |
| Kobolds | 2-4 Kobolds, 1-2 Kobold Alchemist |
| Undead | 1-4 Zombies, 1-2 Skeletons |

The monsters in this room will act differently if they have been alerted by the guards. If alerted they will form a semicircle around the door waiting for the players to enter or trigger the snare trap. On hearing the trap trigger the monsters will open the door and ambush the players, giving the monsters a surprise round for initiative. Otherwise they will attack once the door is opened. The guard or guards that alerted the temple will take part in the fight as well, adding to this rooms monsters.

Should the players successfully sneak their way inside the monsters in this room will be disorganized, giving the players a surprise round for initiative. After this fight the temple will be alerted to the players presence, regardless of whether they sneaked past the guards.

#### Hallway

A small, narrow hallway with two doorways. The door on the right leads to the storeroom, while the far door leads to the altar room. The hallway has no light, and has a tripwire between the storeroom and altar doors. A successful Perception check against an average challenge will reveal the trap. Triggering the trap causes rocks to fall from the ceiling. Players make a Dexterity save against a hard challenge, taking 3 wound dice in bludgeoning damage on fail.

#### Storeroom

A small storeroom filled with stolen goods the monsters have collected. The goods may belong to a nearby town, giving the players a reward for returning it, or it could just be items the monsters collected. The players can make an Investigation check against an easy challenge. On success they find ~40sc worth of enchanting supplies, gemstones, or other valuables, finding a basic healing potion on a critical.

#### Altar Room

A room with an altar to the forest god. On the far wall is a continuation of the mural from the entrance room, depicting a sprawling tree surrounded by elven druids.

##### Monsters
| Type | Monsters |
|:---:|:------|
| Goblins | 2-6 Goblins, 1 Goblin Shaman, 1 Goblin Leader |
| Kobolds | 2-4 Kobolds, 1 Kobold Sorcerer |
| Undead | 1-3 Skeletons, 1-3 Zombies, 1 Necromancer |
