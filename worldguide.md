# World Guide

## Saints and the Divines
Few gods as most know them. The majority are a divine presence given a name. Saints are those so attuned to that divine essence that they can interpret its will. Sometimes a region, a people, or nature itself will coalesce these presence into a divine form. These form greater spirits or lesser gods that watch over an area. For example, a tribe of humans living next to a lake may pray to the lake for a bountiful catch, calm waters, or even healing. This prayer can lead to a greater spirit being born that embodies the ideals and wishes of that tribe. The power of one of these greater spirits is tied to the land over which the spirit watches, and the people that worship it. Spirits worshiped by a many tribes, cities, or entire races have a much greater power than spirits worshiped by one tribe. Damage done to the land the spirit watches is felt by the spirit itself, and can weaken it.

### Saints
Saints are people who are so attuned to the divine that they can channel their will. They are able to interpret the will of those divines, or a portion of it, and use that power to enact its wishes. Saints aren't just particularly powerful priests or clerics, but are capable of performing miracles beyond what mortals are capable. While they are usually as mortal as any other creature, their divine will may protect them from dangers. Even after death their spirit stays with the divine, or becomes a greater spirit to watch over that divine's followers. Particularly powerful priests can even commune with these saints.

Towns are split into different sizes

#### Hamlet
- Population: 0-100
- Notable Buildings: Tavern/Hall, 1 additional building

Very small town, having 3-5 volunteer guards that are called to defend the town while not working other tasks. Will contain a meeting hall or very small tavern. Usually does not have spare room for visitors. Can have a single production building, such as a farm, blacksmith, herbalist, or lumbermill.

#### Village
- Population 100-500
- Notable Buildings: Tavern/Inn, 1 T1 building, 1-2 additional buildings, Lords Manor

A village is usually built along the main roads or around a natural resource. They are large enough to require some form of government, such as a mayor, baron, or other appointed noble. They will have a tavern or inn with rooms for travellers, a blacksmith, and general goods store. Depending on their surroundings they may have a handful of T1 buildings, such as a Market if it is a trade stop, lumber mill, grainary, or quarry. Villages are able to afford 2-3 trained guards along with 10-15 volunteer guards in times of trouble. Some villages may also have a shrine or small church dedicated to a god or saint.

#### Small Town
- Population: 500-2500
- Notable Buildings: Several Taverns, Merchant square, Blacksmith, 3-4 T1 Buildings, 1-2 T2 Buildings, Lords Manor, Church

Small towns are just large enough to be included on maps and contain most of the things needed to sustain trade and travellers. It will have several taverns and inns to host caravans and travellers, a merchant square for caravans to trade, several blacksmiths to handle repairs and potentially even a stable. A small town will be run by a noble, such as a baron or count, who may also oversee the surrounding hamlets and villages. They would be responsible for collecting taxes and protecting their domain. Small Towns are the smallest towns to have a dedicated guard house or fort, maintaining a small reserve of trained guards, between 5-20, with the noble able to field a militia of up to 50 villagers. They will usually have a church or several shrines.

#### Town
- Population: 2500-10000
- Notable Buildings, Taverns, Markets, Blacksmiths, Guilds, 3-4 T2 Buildings, 1 T3 Building, Fort, Church, Lord, Walls

Towns are large, defensible bastions of civilization. They are large enough to require a functioning government, ruled by a count or duke who employs several Barristers or appoints a council. Towns are large enough to be split into districts and will have several guard houses. Towns will normally be defend with wood or stone walls and have a fort or keep for defense. They have several churches, with the church being large enough to have some influence on the government. There is a full force of well trained guards numbering between 50-150. The local noble may have a personal retinue of between 25-50 soldiers, being able to field up to 200 militia in times of need.

#### City

- Notable Buildings: Several T3 Buildings, Fort or Keep

Cities are huge, sprawling towns with multiple districts and layers. Cities will have nearly every amenity that a nation can provide available. Cities may hold a King or ruling noble that oversees the nation, or be run by a duke or other high ranking noble. Cities will have either a council or other government structure that aids in running the city. Cities often have the strictest laws and the ability to police those laws. Cities may have several tiers of guards, with normal town guards handling day to day policing, a group of knights or paladins that deal with crimes against the kingdom, and a kingsguard, a group of loyal knights run directly by the ruling lord. Cities are large enough to have several guilds covering most diciplines, having highly skilled artisans. The guilds are large enough to influence the government. Churches will have the seat of their power located in cities, attracting powerful priests and clerics.

#### Capitol
- Population: 25000+

Capitols are the seat of power for any nation and are able to expand larger than any other city.


### Buildings
Most towns are built around natural resources or an industry, able to offer goods or services based on those buildings. For example, a small town or village without a strong trade presence will not have many goods useful to adventurers. A farming village may have a blacksmith for repairing farm tools and equipment, but would be unable to craft weapons and armor. A Town without a wizard tower may not have spell scrolls for sale. Some buildings come in different tiers. Tiers determine how advanced or expansive the building is and can effect what services are available in that town.

#### Market
The Market is an area or set of buildings open to merchants and traders. Tiers change the size of the market and the array of goods available for sale, with the highest tier markets having the occasional magic item for sale.


| Item | T1 | T2 | T3 |
|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| Net, Rope | Common | Common | Common |
| Barbed Net | Rare | Uncommon | Common |
| Banded Net | Rare | Uncommon | Common |
| Enchanted Net | Very Rare | Rare | Uncommon |
| Caltrops | Uncommon | Common | Common |
| Whistle | Uncommon | Common | Common |
| Smoke Pellet | Rare | Uncommon | Common |
| Black Powder Pellet | Very Rare | Rare | Uncommon |
| Grapple Hook | Uncommon | Common | Common |
| Healers Kit | Rare | Uncommon | Common |
| Bandage | Uncommon | Common | Common |

| Alembic | Very Rare | Uncommon | Common |
| Etching Acid | Rare | Uncommon | Common |
| Linseed Oil | Rare | Uncommon | Common |

#### Blacksmith
A building to repair and craft tools, weapons and armor. T1 buildings are only able to work and repair tools, T2 can craft weapons and armor, while T3 can repair magic items.

#### Wizards Tower
A space for the local wizard to practice their craft and sell spell scrolls. A T1 tower will have cantrip, first level spells, and enchanting supplies, T2 second level spells and a handful of runes, T3 will have third and the occasional 4th level spell. While most wizards possess higher tier spells, few are willing to part with scrolls or create spell scrolls for strangers.

#### Guild
Guilds provide services based on their profession, usually at a premium. Each tier adds another guild and profession.

### Other Buildings
These are buildings add flavor to a town and give some idea of the things the town produces.

#### Herbalist
A herbalist collects plants and herbs from the surrounding wilderness. A town with a herbalist may sell potion making ingredients in the market.

#### Apothecary
Apothecaries mainly brew curatives or remedies to common illnesses, but may also ocassionaly sell cleansing and healing potions, antidotes, poisons, or other low level potions.

#### Fort
Forts provide stability to a region and act as a seat of power for a local noble, such as a baron or count. Forts will usually have a small retinue of soldiers defending it and protecting the surrounding villages and hamlets.

#### Farms
Most villages are surrounded by farms for crops or cattle. Large farms can provide food to multiple villages.

#### Enchanter
Can offer simple enchantments to the players at a premium, and sells enchanting supplies.

#### Quarry
This town has a quarry, providing it with more usable stone than most towns. A town with a quarry has more stone constructions, such as town walls or a fence, windmill, or watch tower.

#### Mine
A mine is usually owned by a noble or guild and has a foreman assigned to oversee the mine. A mine provides a reliable source of metal or valuable materials and so is more heavily guarded than other buildings. A mine may have its own militia or guards to defend it seperate from the towns guards. Because of this mines can end up at odds with the local town government as it can enforce it's own rules.

#### Lumbermill
Provides wood for building and furniture. Towns with lumbermills have cheap access to wood, allowing them to construct fences, watch towers, or pallaside walls.

#### Stable
A building for taking care of and trading horses. A town with a large trade presence will usually have a stable out of necessity to be able to service caravans and traders passing through their town. Players will be able to buy or rent horses from a stable.


### Domains

- roughly a group of aligned cities, towns, or groups ruled by a single power, may be vassals of another domain (eg: a barony is subject to a county or duchy)
- rule hierarchy: Baron -> Count -> Duke -> Regent
- Domains track 4 stats: Influence, Resources, Power (Military/Other), Trade, Intrigue
- Domains take actions every "season", a season is an arbitrary amount of time determined by the GM.
- each action a domain takes costs influence, and potentially other stats

- domains are run by a leader + advisors/lieutenants who provide a portion of their stats to actions
- lieutenants have a number of roles which give different stats

- spymaster: provides either half its stealth or investigation to Intrigue rolls


### Animal Companions
Beasts and creatures with -1 or less Intelligence can become animal companions. Finding an animal companion can be challenging, often becoming an adventure on its own. Under normal circumstances a beast is only eligable to become a companion if it meets these conditions:

- They are young or a newborn.
- They are not hostile.
- They have an Intelligence score of -1 or less

A character can attempt to befriend the animal by making an Animal Handling check against a challenge determined by the GM. On success you befriend the animal and they become your companion. New animal companions are untrained. They will follow you, but will not obey any commands or participate in combat. By default a character can only have a single animal companion, however this can be changed with feats.

#### Intelligent Companions
In some circumstances your GM may allow you to befriend creatures that do not meet the conditions above. In these circumstances you make either an Animal Handling or Conversation check, GM's choice, with the GM determining the challenge. On success they become your companion as normal, however intelligent creatures may obey your commands without training. These companions still require training to effectively fight along side you. Any untrained companion that enters combat is controlled by your GM and acts independently.

#### Training
Companions can be trained to fight and obey your commands. You may train your companion as a downtime action or during a long rest as long as you take no other actions. For every 7 days spent training you make an animal handling roll against a terrible die, adding a bad die for every 5 CR the creature has. After 3 successes you bond with your companion, allowing them to fight and be given commands.

Trained creatures gain 1 proficiency to attacks and 2 proficiency to saving throws. Their max wounds increases based on your level, gaining an extra wound at levels 7, 14, 21, and 28.

#### Fighting Companions
Animal companions take their actions during your turn. Each turn they may move, sprint, and make a single basic attack with you controlling their actions.

While fighting companions have been trained for combat, they are still animals. While your companion is not at full health you make an Animal Handling check at the start of each of your turns. The challenge for this roll is a terrible die, adding a bad die for each adjacent enemy. If the companion is below half health, rounded down, add terrible dice instead. On fail the companion turns feral, spending its turn attacking a random creature in range. If there is no creature in range it moves towards the closest creature and attacks.

#### Advanced Training
Completing an adventure or gaining a level with a companion increases your bond with them, making them more effective in combat. For each adventure completed or level gained you may choose one of the following benefits:

- They make two basic attacks each turn instead of one.
- They learn an attack or maneuver shown on the creatures stat block. You may use this attack or maneuver in place of basic attacks.
- They gain 2 proficiency points.

#### Companion Equipment
Trained companions can be given specially made armor and weapons to aid them in combat. Animal equipment can be enchanted, following the same rules as enchanting character equipment. Animal armor replaces one of their normal defense dice with a superior defense die and animal weapons replace a wound die with a wound for all of their attacks and maneuvers. Animal equipment is expensive, usually requiring a blacksmith to custom fit them to your companion.

| Equipment | Cost (Medium) | Cost (Large) |
|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| Armor | 2pt | 5pt |
| Weapons | 1pt | 2pt, 50sc |

### Feats

#### Beastmaster

To the north is a clearing called Winter's Hallow, containing a cave linked to the Archfey of Winter. The wode is a section of ancient trees where the Elder Tree lives, planted by the Archfey of life.
- To the southeast is a section of dead and blighted trees. The cursed tree Polash lives in this forest, creating blights to collect the blood of beasts or people that come to close. Deep in the blight is a timeless valley with a single witches hut.

### Mt Zoran (And mountain range)
- Mt Zoran is the tallest mountain in the region, surrounded by a deep moat.
- The moat connects to Unda, plane of primal water. The moat is home to merfolk who control the water, protecting mt zoran from outsiders.
- The southeastern shore is cliffs, save where the river meets the sea. The river is filled with waterfalls, making travelling up it by ship impossible.
- Mt Zoran is home to many groups of Harpies, and Harpies inhabit the northern mountain range as well.
- There are a handful of ancient shrines built along the northern coastline overlooking the silver sea.
- The southern mountain range is more humid, becoming almost jungle-like on the eastern edge of the range. That jungle is home to the Serpent warriors and a shrine to the ancient serpent god, still protected by the cursed creatures.
- On the opposite side of the mountain range to the Serpent Warriors is Tael Karrak, the largest Tlani home in Farhome. It is a network of several mountain tops, connected by underground tunnels.

### Haunted Atoll

- Main island/neighboring islands have active volcanos.

## Cities

### Shadowfen Keep
- Population: ~6000
- Fort with a handful of surrounding farms, houses. Large towers near the fort along with several mansions.
- Large, expansive crypts below the fort where most commoners live.
- Towers re open to air, allow air/water to drop down to levels below.
- Furthest depths lead to the burial chambers, long forgotten tombs, undead filled crypts.
- Talk of riches in the crypts below draw adventurers or others looking to earn fame and fortune.
- Unnatural fogs and cloudy skies make sunlight rare, even on the surface. Some force keeps the more dangerous beasts away.
- Ruled by a Baron living in the keep above ground.

#### The Labyrinth
- A huge network of passages, rooms, burial chambers, etc built under shadowfen keep.
- The closest portions are used by the city to house people, are used for industry, etc. With the less explored and more dangerous areas closed off or baricaded.
- An elevator linked to a chain pulley is used to decend deeper into the labyrinth, seperating the explored from the unexplored areas.
- The unexplored areas are filled with undead, rats, ratlings, or other beasts. Some of the passages lead into open cave networks.
- a thief/cult group has mapped out certain areas of the labyrinth, allowing them to move undetected and undermine the baron.

### Myrefall

- City is big on bartering and deals with money only when they have to, or for drinks. They make a variety of hard liquors and the town is often awake into the late night.
- Deals/agreements are ingrained into the culture of the town, to the point they'd have a special wood for dealbreakers. While deals are to be kept at all costs if possible, they are negoiable, and can be superceded by another deal. For example, making a deal to backstab someone while already in a deal with them is seen as more moral than just not following through with the original deal.

#### The Broker
- a very influential merchant living in the heart of Myrefall.
- Is often used as a record keeper for various deals between parties, stores collateral/payments for the parties.
- No one in town goes against the Brokers wishes, with those that wrong the Broker quickly finding themselves food for the Myrelurk stalkers.

- Very welcoming town, many towers, small forts, taverns, all with colorful flags.
- Home to many Orders, such as paladins, monster hunters, or adventurering groups.

### Hogsfeet
- Population: ~12,000
- Ruled by Lord Thornbrook, though most of his power is superficial. The town is ruled by the various merchant guilds and self made nobles.
- The nobles are split between the old families (~3 main families?) and the new blood merchants using their money to buy influence with the people.
- Hogsfeet is constantly muddy with it raining for the majority of the year. The deity of the lake northwest of Hogsfeet often creates rainstorms to water the crops and strengthen the rivers.
- Of the main cities is probably the most distrustful of magic. There are few actual wizards, with the exception of the court seer, and so the town sees most magic as courting disaster. Divine magic being the exception, as the temple dedicated to the deity of the lake is very popular in Hogsfeet, with the majority of the town travelling to it for healing and aid.
- City is built on labor and trade of raw resources. The Faewyn to the north and mountains to the west, and bountiful fields allows hogsfeet to produce a good chunk of the raw resources used by other cities. This leads to the population being on the poorer side, including the nobles, while the guilds/companies/merchants gain power and wealth.

#### Mud Docks
- a large piece of the city borders the thornbrook river, leading directly to farhome. The rain and general wetness causes this area to be especially muddy, almost constantly covered in a thick layer of mud.
- The many docks service all kinds of ships and rafts, the safest and quickest route to farhome.
- The docks have many warehouses on the outer edges where the ground is more stable, filled with raw goods waiting to be shipped.

#### Trade Quarter
- surrounding the hill of Thornbrook Keep is the trade quarter, larger houses and mansions where the rich merchants and nobles live.
- Is the cleanest portion of the city and is surrounded by pallisade walls, separating the inner city from the sprawling outer city.

#### Thornbrook Keep
- Keep of Lord Thornbrook, ruler of Hogsfeet.
- Made mainly of wood, is more of a barracks/great hall than a proper keep. Built on top of the rocky hill on the edge of hogsfeet.
- Pallisade walls surround the keep and the Trade Quarter.

#### The Sprawl
- A large area filled with houses, inns, and taverns on the other side of the wall.
- Due to the muddy, unstable ground buildings aren't larger than 1-2 stories. Many buildings have sunken into the ground over the years, causing them to lean slightly. The buildings inthe sprawl are packed near the walls, creating winding, tight alleys and roads.
- The parts furthest from the river are turned into farmland, being extremely fertile ground and growing a huge amount of surplus food.
- Sprawl is filled with various breweries, with nearly every tavern having their own meads and ales.

### Wintergate
- Population: ~10000 exiles, ~7000 barbarians
- Wintergate is the main arrival point for exiles coming from the Empire.
- The city is partially founded on the northern barbarians land, and so the barbarians claim ownership and influence over those parts of the town. They insist that part of the town obey their laws as well, and usually have the strength to uphold those laws.
- There are various fighting rings where exiles and barbarians alike try to earn fame and money.
- Due to a good chunk of the city being new/past exiles with no support, there are a large amount of adventurering groups, mercenaries for hire, or bandit groups opperating in the city. 
- Between the mercenaries/bandits/barbarians there is no real power structure governing the town, just group desperation against the unforgiving cold and wilderness. This makes it a more or less lawless town, with specific laws upheld depending on the most powerful gang/group in the area that enforces it.

### Rogueport

- The entrances winds down into a huge cavern, once the home of an adamantine dragon.

- Incredibly secretive of their home, preventing outsiders from entering unless they have a written invitation from a dwarven lord.
- A holding city, Spring Town, has been built just before the gate where merchants wait for invitations, sell goods with dwarves/each other, or come for the hot springs.
- Deep in Dur buldar are the dwarven vaults, said to filled with treasures and rare ores found from their mines.
- Dur buldar has many mines, digging deep into the world. Several have breeched the underdark, or found pits of monsters waiting to be opened. Those mines are quickly collapsed for the protection of the city.

- Between The upper and lower city is the Canal Ward, a manmade canal carved into the upper city. The majority of bridges between the two cities goes through the Canal Ward.
- The police are split into two groups, the Castellan Knights in the upper city and the Wardens of the lower city. The Castellan Knights keep the peace in the upper city, seeking out and destroying anything that could harm the city. The Wardens police the lower city, but are mainly tasked with keeping the lower city from interfering with upper city business. The Castellan Knights supercedes the Wardens authority and may freely investigating anything they deem a threat, even in the lower city.
- There are 3 major powers in the city: the Castellan Knights, the council of Guilds (run by nobles guild representatives), and the Temple of Kella (goddess of civilization/protection, or saint equivalent?)
- Lesser powers/organizations: The Mages (Enacra Drazi, Velka von Valkyr, etc), the Wet Works, Wardens, Temple of Myrah, Order of the Flame, Red Lions,

#### The Underways
- a series of sewers, roads, cellars, and basements linking various areas of the lower and upper city below Farhome. Here you can find the undermarket, an open market without the restrictions of the city above, as well as the wet works, a group of lower city assassins.

- Town on the edge of toadfen swamp and Ashwood forest. The city is built on 3 plateaus,, the massive ~120 ft tall ash trees surround half the city, with the swamp border roughly a mile out.
- The main entryway into the city is through elevator, although long, winding paths exist that you could climb single file.
- The 3 bluffs/plateaus are connected with bridges, with the tallest plateau reserved for the richest inhabitants. The lowest bluff is where the skilled labor and lower class tradesmen live.
- In between the 3 plateaus are where outsiders/the poorest people live, in wooden huts built along the bluff walls. These densely populated hut towns are connected with ramshackle bridges built out of whatever pieces are available, with new bridges added almost at random when convenient to someone.
- Ashgrove is distrustful of the lizardfolk, who hunted the first humans who entered their teritory. Lizardfolk are relegated to the hut towns along the walls and cannot enter the city itself.

### Tlani Homes
- Tlani burrows, or Tael, are where the majority of Tlani in Farhome live.
