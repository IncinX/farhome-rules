## Saints and the Divines
Few gods as most know them. The majority are a divine presence given a name. Saints are those so attuned to that divine essence that they can interpret its will. Sometimes a region, a people, or nature itself will coalesce these presence into a divine form. These form greater spirits or lesser gods that watch over an area. For example, a tribe of humans living next to a lake may pray to the lake for a bountiful catch, calm waters, or even healing. This prayer can lead to a greater spirit being born that embodies the ideals and wishes of that tribe. The power of one of these greater spirits is tied to the land over which the spirit watches, and the people that worship it. Spirits worshiped by a many tribes, cities, or entire races have a much greater power than spirits worshiped by one tribe. Damage done to the land the spirit watches is felt by the spirit itself, and can weaken it.

### Saints
Saints are people who are so attuned to the divine that they can channel their will. They are able to interpret the will of those divines, or a portion of it, and use that power to enact its wishes. Saints aren't just particularly powerful priests or clerics, but are capable of performing miracles beyond what mortals are capable. While they are usually as mortal as any other creature, their divine will may protect them from dangers. Even after death their spirit stays with the divine, or becomes a greater spirit to watch over that divine's followers. Particularly powerful priests can even commune with these saints.

A small town will be run by a noble, such as a baron or count, who may also oversee the surrounding hamlets and villages. They would be responsible for collecting taxes and protecting their domain.

Cities may have several tiers of guards, with normal town guards handling day to day policing, a group of knights or paladins that deal with crimes against the kingdom, and a kingsguard, a group of loyal knights run directly by the ruling lord.

- Population: 25000+

Capitols are the seat of power for any nation and are able to expand larger than any other city.


### Buildings
Most towns are built around natural resources or an industry, able to offer goods or services based on those buildings. For example, a small town or village without a strong trade presence will not have many goods useful to adventurers. A farming village may have a blacksmith for repairing farm tools and equipment, but would be unable to craft weapons and armor. A Town without a wizard tower may not have spell scrolls for sale. Some buildings come in different tiers. Tiers determine how advanced or expansive the building is and can effect what services are available in that town.

#### Market
The Market is an area or set of buildings open to merchants and traders. Tiers change the size of the market and the array of goods available for sale, with the highest tier markets having the occasional magic item for sale.

A space for the local wizard to practice their craft and sell spell scrolls. A T1 tower will have cantrip, first level spells, and enchanting supplies, T2 second level spells and a handful of runes, T3 will have third and the occasional 4th level spell. While most wizards possess higher tier spells, few are willing to part with scrolls or create spell scrolls for strangers.

#### Guild
Guilds provide services based on their profession, usually at a premium. Each tier adds another guild and profession.

### Other Buildings
These are buildings add flavor to a town and give some idea of the things the town produces.

#### Herbalist
A herbalist collects plants and herbs from the surrounding wilderness. A town with a herbalist may sell potion making ingredients in the market.

#### Apothecary
Apothecaries mainly brew curatives or remedies to common illnesses, but may also ocassionaly sell cleansing and healing potions, antidotes, poisons, or other low level potions.

#### Fort
Forts provide stability to a region and act as a seat of power for a local noble, such as a baron or count. Forts will usually have a small retinue of soldiers defending it and protecting the surrounding villages and hamlets.

#### Farms
Most villages are surrounded by farms for crops or cattle. Large farms can provide food to multiple villages.

#### Enchanter
Can offer simple enchantments to the players at a premium, and sells enchanting supplies.

#### Quarry
This town has a quarry, providing it with more usable stone than most towns. A town with a quarry has more stone constructions, such as town walls or a fence, windmill, or watch tower.

#### Mine
A mine is usually owned by a noble or guild and has a foreman assigned to oversee the mine. A mine provides a reliable source of metal or valuable materials and so is more heavily guarded than other buildings. A mine may have its own militia or guards to defend it seperate from the towns guards. Because of this mines can end up at odds with the local town government as it can enforce it's own rules.

#### Lumbermill
Provides wood for building and furniture. Towns with lumbermills have cheap access to wood, allowing them to construct fences, watch towers, or pallaside walls.

#### Stable
A building for taking care of and trading horses. A town with a large trade presence will usually have a stable out of necessity to be able to service caravans and traders passing through their town. Players will be able to buy or rent horses from a stable.


### Domains

- roughly a group of aligned cities, towns, or groups ruled by a single power, may be vassals of another domain (eg: a barony is subject to a county or duchy)
- rule hierarchy: Baron -> Count -> Duke -> Regent
- Domains track 4 stats: Influence, Resources, Power (Military/Other), Trade, Intrigue
- Domains take actions every "season", a season is an arbitrary amount of time determined by the GM.
- each action a domain takes costs influence, and potentially other stats

- domains are run by a leader + advisors/lieutenants who provide a portion of their stats to actions
- lieutenants have a number of roles which give different stats

- spymaster: provides either half its stealth or investigation to Intrigue rolls


### Animal Companions
Beasts and creatures with -1 or less Intelligence can become animal companions. Finding an animal companion can be challenging, often becoming an adventure on its own. Under normal circumstances a beast is only eligable to become a companion if it meets these conditions:

- They are young or a newborn.
- They are not hostile.
- They have an Intelligence score of -1 or less

A character can attempt to befriend the animal by making an Animal Handling check against a challenge determined by the GM. On success you befriend the animal and they become your companion. New animal companions are untrained. They will follow you, but will not obey any commands or participate in combat. By default a character can only have a single animal companion, however this can be changed with feats.

#### Intelligent Companions
In some circumstances your GM may allow you to befriend creatures that do not meet the conditions above. In these circumstances you make either an Animal Handling or Conversation check, GM's choice, with the GM determining the challenge. On success they become your companion as normal, however intelligent creatures may obey your commands without training. These companions still require training to effectively fight along side you. Any untrained companion that enters combat is controlled by your GM and acts independently.

#### Training
Companions can be trained to fight and obey your commands. You may train your companion as a downtime action or during a long rest as long as you take no other actions. For every 7 days spent training you make an animal handling roll against a terrible die, adding a bad die for every 5 CR the creature has. After 3 successes you bond with your companion, allowing them to fight and be given commands.

Trained creatures gain 1 proficiency to attacks and 2 proficiency to saving throws. Their max wounds increases based on your level, gaining an extra wound at levels 7, 14, 21, and 28.

#### Fighting Companions
Animal companions take their actions during your turn. Each turn they may move, sprint, and make a single basic attack with you controlling their actions.

While fighting companions have been trained for combat, they are still animals. While your companion is not at full health you make an Animal Handling check at the start of each of your turns. The challenge for this roll is a terrible die, adding a bad die for each adjacent enemy. If the companion is below half health, rounded down, add terrible dice instead. On fail the companion turns feral, spending its turn attacking a random creature in range. If there is no creature in range it moves towards the closest creature and attacks.

#### Advanced Training
Completing an adventure or gaining a level with a companion increases your bond with them, making them more effective in combat. For each adventure completed or level gained you may choose one of the following benefits:

- They make two basic attacks each turn instead of one.
- They learn an attack or maneuver shown on the creatures stat block. You may use this attack or maneuver in place of basic attacks.
- They gain 2 proficiency points.

#### Companion Equipment
Trained companions can be given specially made armor and weapons to aid them in combat. Animal equipment can be enchanted, following the same rules as enchanting character equipment. Animal armor replaces one of their normal defense dice with a superior defense die and animal weapons replace a wound die with a wound for all of their attacks and maneuvers. Animal equipment is expensive, usually requiring a blacksmith to custom fit them to your companion.

| Equipment | Cost (Medium) | Cost (Large) |
|:----:|:----:|
| Armor | 2pt | 5pt |
| Weapons | 1pt | 2pt, 50sc |
